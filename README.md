# BLUPF90 public forum (beta test)

This website is a public area for open discussion about BLUPF90 and related programs.

## Support 

The support is community-based for a public version of BLUPF90 programs.
Any people, regardless of whether they belong to the University of Georgia or not, may provide an answer to a question, useful information, and a pointer to a useful website.
It is not guaranteed that you timely receive a correct answer or a useful comment.

For now, there are two options where you post your question, suggestion, or bug report.

- [Blupf90 discussion group at Yahoo Group](https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/blupf90/info) : This is a forum/mailing-list we have been using. We will continue to use Yahoo Group for a while.
- [BLUPF90 public forum - issues](https://github.com/ABGG-UGA/blupf90-public/issues) : This website. It gives you a modern interface to share your issue. It will be more useful if you have an account of GitHub.

All the past messages exchanged in the Yahoo Group are available on this website: see [the archive directory](https://github.com/ABGG-UGA/blupf90-public/tree/master/archive).
