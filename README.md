The support is community-based.
Any people, regardless of whether they belong to the University of Georgia or not, may provide an answer to a question, useful information, and a pointer to a useful website.
It is not guaranteed that you timely receive a correct answer or a useful comment.

For now, there are two options where you post your question, suggestion, or bug report.
