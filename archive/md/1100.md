Hello,I am running a pedigree-based multi-trait analysis to estimate genetic parameters and to obtain breeding values
of selection candidate.
I have been running the same analysis using VCE and remlf90. For both programs, I used the same length of pedigree and
the same data file. I also used the same solving method for both software (FSPAK). I didnâ€™t use the option use_yams.
Following convergence, (co)variance matrices are the same for both software. There is also a very strong correlation
between the solutions estimated using the two softwares. However, the variance among breeding value is smaller using
F90 compared to VCE. I am surely missing something but I thought that, all else being equal, I should have estimated
the exact same breeding values independently of the software used. Has anyone else observed this? Is the FSPAK routine
identical in F90 and VCE?
I apologize for my English and thank you in advance for your help,
Regards,
Romuald ROUGER
