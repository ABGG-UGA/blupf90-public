1. the parameter file for thrgibbsf90 file is below.


2. What I could infer about the renf90.par file is that the renumf90 program did not renumber the animals within the
pedigree file (that is the sire's pedigree) because in the outputs there is not the renadd.ped file. so, as you
confirmed to me, the renumf90 does not work for sire model. I did not realize that. 


I would like to use sire model because I want to compare variance components estimated using different approaches. I
have read in literature, that various authors have found good estimates of genetic parameters using sire model through
Bayesian inference. That's why I wanted to test it, to see if it does work in my case. If I want to use sire model
applying animal model, will the pedigree file contain sire's ID (as animal ID)- sire's sire's ID, and sire's dam's ID?,
or will be the file set up initially?


3. I had taken it into account, but I wanted to test first without the inclusion of a fixed effect, I didn't think that
it was imperative. But, I will follow your suggestion and I will include an additional fixed effect in the model and
run the programs one again.


4. I will consider that option to calculate posterior means and SD for heritability in postgibbs analysis.


The renf90.par file is the following:

Thank you so much for having read my questions. Your answers are so helpful to me.
