 This is a weird bug related to sampling the variances and very little data. The subroutine sampling chi squared
deviates cannot use -2 as degrees of freedom with so little data.
 Â Put "4" as degrees of freedom for the initial variances, this is a low value that won't get you in trouble
 If you want to use an animal effect, you need to put a pedigree file !!! Hence the "File does not exist"

  Â Hi Andres, Â Thanks for your reply. Iâ€™ve replaced the column you mentioned with a vector of numbers. The program
does now recognise the 6 records in the data file, but the program still stalls at the same point as before. If you
have any other ideas please let me know. Â Cheers,Alex Â From: blupf90@yahoogroups.com [mailto:blupf90@yahoogroups.com]

 Â Â There is an "F" in your data file, and the read statements only read numbers. This may be the problem.On 11/10/15

Â Hi,Â Iâ€™m currently trying to run a BayesCPi model in GS3. Iâ€™ve used example files from the Feb 2013 course in
Padova as a template for my own files, but I canâ€™t get them to run correctly. When I look at the log, the program
does not seem to be recognising any records in the datafile (â€œdata file: testPheno_gs3.txtÂ Â Â Â  with:Â Â  0
recordsâ€), and I assume its as a result of this that the program stops at â€œtransforming yZW ->multiplyweighted =
Tâ€ and never starts any iterations - it doesnâ€™t give me an error, it just never moves past this point. Can anyone
advise me what it is that Iâ€™ve done wrong to stop this from working? Data files etc are attached. This is based on a
small test data set so the number of iterations etc is much smaller than I would use for a proper run.Â Also, I tried
to add an animal effect (1 add_animal 10), but whenever I try to include this in the parameter file I get a fortran
error â€“ â€œAt line 272 of file ../src/gs3.f90 (unit = 7, file = â€˜Ó±ÆšÃ³â€™) Fortran runtime error: File â€˜â€™ does
not existâ€. If anyone could tell me what causes this and what I can do to avoid it Iâ€™d also be really grateful.Â
Best wishes,Alex
