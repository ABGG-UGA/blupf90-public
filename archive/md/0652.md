Hi all,I am working on an analysis with embryo transfer data for which I would like to estimate variance components for
effect of the recipient, donor dam, and service sire, as well as the covariance between them using the relationship
matrix. The dependent variable is binary so I plan on using thrgibbs to estimate these.
In reviewing some of the message board posts, it seems like there is a way to do this (e.g.,
https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/blupf90/conversations/messages/516). I'm just not sure the best way to go about it.
Is there a way to code this for the renumf90 parameter file or can that not be used in this case? Any suggestions or
guidance would be greatly appreciated!
Thanks,Kristen
