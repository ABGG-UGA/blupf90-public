Thank you for your report. I am figuring out the reason why it fails. Please make sure the following configuration:


- Unlimited stack size. When typing `ulimit` in your shell, you will see `unlimited`. Otherwise, you have to type
`ulimit -s unlimited` before running the program (or put it into .bash_profile or .bashrc; then log-out and log-in
again). This is unrelated to the amount of memory installed in the computer.


- OpenMP stack size. When typing `echo $OMP_STACKSIZE` in your shell, you will see some numbers like 32M etc. If
nothing is shown, it is better to set this environment variable. Type `export OMP_STACKSIZE=64M` and run airemlf90. If
it fails, please gradually increase the number (to 128M, 256M, etc). You can put it into .bash_*. This is also
unrelated to the physical memory amount.



Recent update that we made needs a bit more memory. The compiler may change the memory management strategy so that we
have to care of it manually.
