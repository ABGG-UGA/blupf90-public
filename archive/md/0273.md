Running one single reml round  is equivalent to run blupf90. 

you can get prediction error for solutions using OPTION sol se

 Both airemlf90 and remlf90 give breeding values for all animals in the pedigree file, even if they are not present in
the data file.
 So, no problem with that.

 My question focused on prediction for unmeasured individuals (i.e. missing values, or hypothetical individuals).
 Running blupf90 in a second step is a good option, I think.

 I just thought I could do it in one single reml run.
 In fact, I have done it with remlf90. But today I noticed the warning issued by airemlf90.

 Thank you for your useful responses.

 If you need to predict breeding values for animals with no phenotypes and no genotypes, those breeding values are
parent averages, so you don't have to include those animals in the input data file. Instead you can include them in the
pedigree file (e.g., using ped_depth 0 with renumf90, you will have all related animals in your renaddxx.ped). And run
blupf90 to predict breeding values for all animals in the pedigree file.
