I am using predf90 software to predict DGV based on the effects of ~ 400,000 SNP. However, the software is given the
following error: genotypes file is empty
I verified all the files and apparently they are ok! When I run with a lower number of SNP (~ 40k), the software works
fine. What can be the problem?
Regards,Juliana.
