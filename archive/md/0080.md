 Quite honestly: rendom is a difficult program. One way is to write a program that computes the dominance relationhsip
matrix (look for rules in good books of quantitative genetics like Lynch & Walsh, or Larry Schaeffer notes, or used the
attached paper assuming no inbreeding), then invert it using for instance R, or Fortran, or whatever you like, and
store it as a text file. Then use user_file facility in blup/remlf90

 You will indeed need some programming by yourself. This you can do perhaps for up to 5000 individuals.

 Hello everyone, good day

 Does anyone have time can help me to figure out this problem?
 I know this can be done by "REDOMN" program, but have no idea how and where is the program.
 Thank you for helping
