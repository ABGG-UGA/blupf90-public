Dear.
My name is Jaime Pi√±eira and I am trying to perform progeny tests in dairy cattle.
As an initial test I am using the month and year of lactation as fixed effect factors for the trait to be evaluated.
But the young bulls and cows that do not have breastfeeding and do not know what value to put in the data record of
month and year of lactation.
When it is a missing productive data I put "0". But what should I put in the month and year of breastfeeding as fixed
effect factors?
