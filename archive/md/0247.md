Dear friends
 
I want to use the dairypack (from blupf90)
for analyzing of my data. 
I want to estimate variances,
but when I run the program with choosing 
re-estimate of variances option,
unfortunately in the blup.par file I see the given priors 
as final  estimations, 

may I am doing wrong?
```
