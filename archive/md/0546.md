I wanted to restart remlf90 by plugging in the last obtained estimates (after 24h of computing) as starting values but
apparently the covar-matrix for a random effect was not pos definite.So my question was if more decimals could
alleviate the problem and if one could print those estimates with more decimals?
Thank you
Steven
