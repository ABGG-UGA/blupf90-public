 You can calculate base frequencies and input into the program.We doâ€™n use base frequencies because they were not useful. See papers by Aguilar, Forni and Vitezica.

Dear all


I was working on single step analysis.


In ssGBLUP I am using allelic frequency of genotyped animals alone, 


Is there any way to obtain allelic frequencies of base population and then use it?


or Is there an option where I can define which are the base animals in my data and use their allelic frequency alone?


Regards,
