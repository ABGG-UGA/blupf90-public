You do not have records with both traits non missing, so that you cannot get the covariance.
 What you can do is to split the residual of the single measument trait in two term, one correlated with the multiple
measurement trait and the other, the actual residual, uncorrelated.
 To fit the first residual term you can define a factor specific to individual records in the single measurement trait
and this factor to be correlated with the the permanent enviromental effect of the multiple measurement trait.
 Hsve a look to garcia and baselga (200?) in livestock production science. They used this trick for jointly studing
growth during fattening (single measuremt) and prolificacy (repetibility model)

Subject: [blupf90] Two-trait analysis: RR and single-measure trait


 Dear all.
I'm trying to work with a two-trait analysis with a random regression model for one trait (e.g.: test-day milk yield)
and a single-measure model for the other trait (e.g.: lactation length).
I'm not sure how to model/interpret residual covariances.
I'm trying to run this analysis using a data file like this:
 animal  ...   RR-trait     SingleM-trait  ...
      1  ...	   10.2 		0  ...	    1  ...	 15.3		      0  ...	  .		 .     
	    0  ...	.	       .		  0  ...      . 	     .			0  ...	    1 
...	    0		     301  ...	   .	  .	 .
and a parameter file like this (p.s.: I have other fixed effects...):

However, the results do not make sense. The additive variances are overestimated.

Does someone have any idea?
Thanks in advance.
