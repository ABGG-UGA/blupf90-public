Thanks Andres,
How can the second method you suggest be done? are there examples available?

 HI Andres, I have run analyses for the single trait and 2-trait analyses and have the -2 log likelihoods. My question
is when i subtract the -2 log L of the model with 2 traits from that with 1 trait with this be testing for the genetic
or residual variances?

 Actually, you will test both !

 Or do you want to run a model with ONE residual variance and TWO genetic variances? (Or the opposite) This is doable
but more complicated...

Kindly assist
