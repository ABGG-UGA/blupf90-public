```
Some problems were detected running renumf90 and blupf90 related programs with files with older Mac newline format
(^M), where all data is reading as one big line. 

 In order to run properly, files should be in Unix newline type format. MS-DOS newline format should work also, but
Unix format is recommended. 

 Details about newline formats are here:

 In Linux environments dos2unix and related commands are available to convert files

 Binaries of a command line tool (flip) for different OS is available here:

 Also some editors (like notepad++, etc.) could make the conversion to different newline formats.
