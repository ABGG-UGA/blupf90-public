Thank you Andres,
I was not sure about what the program call of "GimA22i". Now I know that the steps of scale, blend and subtract the A22
matrix from G occur to form the GimA22i. The matrix that I had was formed by taking the G (made as in VanRaden, 2007)
and weghing this G with the A, as 0.05A + 0.095G ( to assure that the matrix was invertible). Than I inverted this
blended matrix. So this isn't the GimA22i, because I didn't subtracted this final matrix from the A inverted. I can do
this last step and use in the program. Thank you again,
Raphael.

  I correct the mistake (see below)

  Raphael,
 it is unclear what you do and what you want to do.

 If you want to use genomic relationships (G) in a model of the kind
 y=Xb+Zu+e, Var(u) = G sigma^2_u

 then extractimg GimA22i and plugging it into your R script as if it were the matrix "G" is not correct.
 GimA22i = inv(G) - inv(A22) 
 so this is not G.

 pregsf90 gives you options to write G.

 On the other hand, if you use GimA22i in gibbs1f90 as we explained, then you are using G because it does create

 H=inv(A ) -GimA22i = G


 Actually, inv(H)= inv(A) - GimA22i = inv(G)

 in your case.

 Dear Andres,
that was exactly what I did. My goal is to perform a analysis considering a GimA22i matrix instead of the A matrix. For
that, I have an A matrix with the same dimension of the A22 matrix and the G (all the animals have genotype). But
somehow the results obtained here were a little different from that I obtained runnig a program in R where I could just
provided my GimA22i instead off the A matrix in a multiple trait animal model. I don't know if there is some step that
I'm forgetting about the Gibbs1f90 (with the preGS) program, maybe some scaling. This difference should be a sample
problem too, but I just wanted to make sure that I'm using the program in the correct way.
Thank you again,
Raphael.

  Raphael,

 In practice, the program creates H = A-1 + (GimA22i)
 if A = A22 then 
 H = A-1 + (GimA22i) = G
 For this to be true, you need same pedigree to create GimA22i (with preGS) than for your Gibbs analysis.
 The other possibility is to let Gibbs1f90 to create GimA22i without going through preGS.

 Professor Ignacy,
when I runned the Gibbs1f90 with a regular pedigree and with a empty file the results are different even I had used the
OPTION readGimA22i for both analysis. How the GimA22i is the last matrix formed by the program I would expect the same
result for both, because the pedigree wouldn't have any influence on the inverse weighted G matrix formed. Using the
OPTION readGimA22i, do I need to necessarily provide the A matrix and the  "x.dat_XrefID"file? I'm not sure that the
program is reading correctly and doing the calculations only with the matrix that I provided (GimA22i), is there any
other influences? Thank you again, best wishes,
RaphaelRocha Wenceslau.

 The best way to do it in the current system is to use an empty pedigree file.

is there any way to use the Gibbs1f90 providing the G matrix or the inverse of the G matrix (already done) with no
pedigree file or A matrix? Thank you,
