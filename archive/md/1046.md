Hello!
I am trying to run a random regression model to study reaction norms, but the analysis aren't working. 
For one trait, the inverse of AI matrix (Sampling Variance) and the Correlations from inverse of AI matrix are full of
zeros:inverse of AI matrix (Sampling Variance)	0.11057E-01  0.50675E-03   0.0000	0.0000	     0.0000	
0.50675E-03  0.23273E-04   0.0000	0.0000	     0.0000	  0.0000       0.0000	    0.0000	 0.0000      
0.0000	     0.0000	  0.0000       0.0000	   0.19212E-02	 0.0000       0.0000	   0.0000	0.0000	    
0.0000	     0.0000    Correlations from inverse of AI matrix	1.0000	    0.99894	  0.0000       0.0000	   
0.0000	    0.99894	  1.0000       0.0000	    0.0000	 0.0000       0.0000	   0.0000	0.0000	    
0.0000	     0.0000	  0.0000       0.0000	    0.0000	 1.0000       0.0000	   0.0000	0.0000	    
0.0000	     0.0000	  0.0000    
For the other trait, the convergence it's not being achieve, since the analysis only stops when reach the maximum
number of round. I tried to run 50,000 and 100,000 rounds and happen in both situations.
Is someone knows what might be happening? I'm considering the existence of heterogeneity of the environmental variances
in both traits. I'm running four analysis and for two of them everything went well and for those traits, it's not
working the same steps.
Thanks!
