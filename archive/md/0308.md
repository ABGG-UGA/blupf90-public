May be I did explain my question correctly. The parameter file executes thrgibbs1f90, but gibbs samples look like this:
	150  rounds
 G
   826.5
 G
   1596.
 R
   0.000
### which set the residual variance to zero and the sample values for direct genetic and CG variance are very high.
That is why I thought there is somrthing wrong with the parameter file


Thanks
