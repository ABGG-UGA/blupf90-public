Thank you so much for these notes, I thought that the software can make these estimates by itself like in MTDFREML and I thought that I only missed a line helping in getting these results. I am new in using this software and I am doing my best to learn it, If you could provide my with useful notes explaining the whole process, I will be greatful. Thank you one more time.
