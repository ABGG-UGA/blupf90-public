Dr. Muir, if happens for one animal have missing observations for all the traits, GIBBS*F90 will not accept.At least
one of the traits needs a observation.
If you delete those animals from the datafile, the program should run.

 Hi Breno and Shogo I reduced the problem down to single trait and get same problem.  However, I am unsure what you
mean by remove zero observations for all traits, does this mean than GIBBS cannot accept missing observations?	I can
assure that for this single trait it is not missing. Bill
