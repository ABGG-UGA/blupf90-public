 Marcelo, the point is not the amount of animals. The point is that if you do not have a very good genealogy inbreeding goes unobserved.

 Consider animals with only one generation of recorded pedigree. parent-offspring and sib relationships are correct. But inbreeding will be declared as 0, and this will be false.
 G can see this inbreeding even in absence of pedigree

Â To add more information to the discussion, the pedigree had 13 generations (85000 animals) and it came from a line from a swine breeding program. Lowest inbreeding coefficient (considering 1000 genotyped animals only) was 1.02 and highest was 1.37. So, I do not believe this pedigree was the reason for that really low inbreeding correlation. Also,Â running ROH for the same group of animals, inbreeding correlation between ROH and G diagonal was 0.24 only. 
 
 ROH is recent inbreeding and G can be very old one.

 
So, my theory is that, maybe, my sample (1000 genotyped animals) was not enough to estimate real inbreeding. I know that when using a pedigree, to estimate inbreeding coefficients, we miss a lot of information from mendelian sampling, but will genomic information be always better? Even with 500, 700, or a 1000 genotyped animals?

 
Also, how precise is G matrix with only a 1000 animals? Or ROH?

 
Now, about my comments on my last message, by running a simulation, I observed that it is possible to have a low correlation like that, even with higher correlation with diagonal and off-diagonal terms together. So, numerically, this situation is feasible.

 
Regards,

 
Marcelo Freitas
