Sorry for mistaken reply.
 Both should be similar. Note that phenotypic  variances are computed using phenotypic records without any adjustments
for fixed effects and REML estimates should be independent of fixed effects.

 Hellow sir.I'm work in  RURAL DEVELOPMENT ADMINISTRATION(south korea)
Nowdays, I Study on Genetic Parameters of Primal cuts and Carcass Traits in Korea Hanwoo cattle. at that time i used
REMLF90 software. 

My question is...

How is different between phenotypic correlations coefficient(in REMLF90 using by G+E=P) and observed phenotypic
correlation coefficient(in RENUMF90)?
 I will be waiting for your answer.
