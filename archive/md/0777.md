Thank you Ignacy for your prompt response.

 Is this alternative specification currently available in PROGSF90?

 This means that if I had:

 EFFECTS

 5 0 cov 8

 6 0 cov 9

 7 888 cov 10 # first competition effect (grouped with previous two lines)

 11 0 cov 14

 12 0 cov 15

 13 888 cov 16 # second competition effect (grouped with previous two lines)

 17 0 cov 20

 18 0 cov 21

 19 888 cov 22 # third competition effect (grouped with previous two lines)


 Then I would be able to specify

 RANDOM_GROUP

 1 3


 meaning: "group three effects starting from the first", and it would
 understand that each effect is in fact a group of 3 lines?


 Thanks again.

 ƒacu.-
