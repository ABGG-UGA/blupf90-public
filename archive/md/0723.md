Tong,

Please make sure the following in your parameter file.

- For 2t & 1st-trait, the effect # 14 is cross-classified and its position is 23. Could be 22?
- For 2nd-trait, the model doesn't contain the position 18 but the bivariate models do. Which model is correct?
- For 2t-homogeneous, the model is totally different from 2t-heterogeneous (especially in the nested positions). Should use the same model.
