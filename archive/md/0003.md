Recently I had some problems compiled under Windows. Diagnosis and
 fixes are below.
 Ignacy


 Problem:
 Renumf90 does not read the parameter file at all.

 Reason and fix:
 The file was saved with Notepad (or other editor) using a Unicode
 format. Save the file as ANSI or MSDOS.



 Problem:
 Some Windows programs compiled with a new Absoft compiler (V10) crash right away

 Reason and Fix:
 The new Absoft compiler reduced the amount of default stack space.
 Recompile with option: -stack:0x1000000,0x8000, e.g.,
 f90 -YDEALLOC=ALL *.obj -stack:0x1000000,0x8000 -o reml.exe
```
