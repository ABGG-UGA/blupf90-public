Basically, you have one line per equation: if you add the number of levels for all effects and multiply by the number
of traits, that's your number o solution lines.

Â Thanx for the answer, Ignacio.Â So, ifÂ I have 2 effects, the solutions fileÂ  has two times more rows than the file
renadd04.ped.is that correct?Â I my case, I got 1 effect, and the difference between the 2 files (number of rows)Â was
10%.Â Henrique

solutions file contains all the solution estimates for all effects
regular solutions file contains 4 columns1 trait
2 effect
3 level
4 solution
 ( if OPTION sol se Â column #5 Â SE)Â 


in your case effect 4 (renadd04.ped) so you need to extract rows for col2==4 from the solutions files


for example using the following command in a unix terminal:Â 


awk '$2==4' solutions Â > newfile

Hi Everybody,Â 

Â 

After runningÂ airemlf90,Â i noticed thatÂ the fileÂ SOLUTIONSÂ and the file RENADD04.PEDÂ Â containsÂ differentÂ
numberÂ of rows.
Is thatÂ correct?Â 

regards,Â 

Henrique
