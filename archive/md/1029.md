Hi, How can we traceback pedigree information ?
In my work,  I got 10215 animal data containing Animal ID, dam sire barcode along with sex, birth year month, slaughter
age , slaughter year month , traits etc. I created pedigree file just by copy pasting animal, dam sire bar code. but
when i executed blupf90 renumf90 and airemlf90 I got solution file where there are no animal id but just serial number.
Now its getting difficult to calculate EBV.
Can any one help me in preparing pedigree file or in traceback of pedigree file through any of the blupf90 package or
module,
```
