The output file "solutions" from blupf90 family programs contains solutions for all effects. To calculate a specific
EBV, you need to create your own program to do vector*vector multiplications (e.g., t' a where t is a vector of
polynomials at a specific time period and a is a vector of predictions of random regressions corresponding to each
animal.
