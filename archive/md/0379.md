1, You can remove records with no data. 
 2. Use weights: values 1 for all valid records and 0 for missing (not tested).

 You can ask Rodolfo Ramirez-Valverde: 
 Ramirez-Valverde, R., I. Misztal, and J. .K.. Bertrand. 2001. Comparison of threshold vs linear and animal vs sire
models for predicting direct and maternal genetic effects on calving difficulty in beef cattle. J. Anim. Sci.

Â Hi All,
 I'm trying to compare threshold vs linear model (thrgibbs1f90). Â  cross validation requires setting part of the data
to be missing, but in case of univariate model it wouldn't work (because I have only one trait and some animal don't
have observations).my purpose is estimating breeding values not variance.
 I understand that in order to use thrgibbs1f90, at least one trait should has an observation.
 I don't know what to do. any suggestions? Â 
 ThanksÂ
