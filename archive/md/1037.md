Dear all,I have been running reaction norm analyses in AIREMLF90 and in the 'airemlf90.log' file I get correlation
between intercept and slope of -0.99995. Any ideas why this would happen?
I have attached the parameter, data, pedigree and airemlf90.log files for a better understanding.
The parameter file with its effects is: 2	  1 cov # intercept 3	      1 cov # linear term 4	    1 cov #
quadratic 5	    4 cross   # parity (fixed effect) 6        14 cross   # year-season (fixed effect) 7      504 cross
  # herd (random effect) 2    16358 cov 8   #animal random intercept 3	  16358 cov 8 # animal random linear

Thank you in advance.
Maria
