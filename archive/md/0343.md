Hi all!
I have some doubts and I hope you can help me.I'm testing the fit of wood's function (and others) to model lactation curves with a Random Regression Model.Considering the linear Wood's function [ ln(y)=ln(a) + b.ln(DIM) - c.DIM ], how can I inform the parameter [ln (a)] in data file ? Should I put a constant (for example, 1) to all TD records? And how can I inform this in parameters file?

Tks.Regards.
