Hi everybody,

I am with the following error when running gibbs2f90:

 forrtl: severe (59): list-directed I/O syntax error, unit 50, file /renf90.dat
 Image		    PC	      Routine		 Line	     Source

 gibbs2f90	    08057216  Unknown		    Unknown  Unknown
 libc.so.6	    006D2EDC  Unknown		    Unknown  Unknown

Who knows what is happening with my analysis? If I use remlf90 or airemlf90 there is not this error, only with
gibbs2f90.

 Kind regards,
```
