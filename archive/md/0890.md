## 890: Breeding value prediction with RR model

```
I am running a random regression model with Legendre Polynomials of second order to predict breeding values for milk
production traits. As an output, in the solutions file there are two values relate to the additive effect for each
animal in the pedigree.  
In order to obtain the breeding value for each animal in each day in milk, I am using the following equation:
bv=sol1*x1+sol2*x2
where x1=sqrt(0.5), x2=sqrt(3/2)*t and t=2*(dim-5)/360-1, with dim=days in milk. I want to confirm if this strategy is
correct or if I missing something here. 
Since now, I thank you all for the attention and help. 
Best regards,Juliana Petrini.
