Hello Breno,
My bad, at the true I was founding the mean of second column of the SNP_predictions file, what I found at the PDF
Manual of BlupF90, avaliable in http://nce.ads.uga.edu/wiki/lib/exe/fetch.php?media=blupf90_all2.pdf


Output file:
“SNP_predictions”
- ID, calling rate, and GEBV 


Apologize me and thanks, anyway!
