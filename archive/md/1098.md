Hi,
It should be a bug but it is hard to find the cause without data. Instead, I suggest some workarounds.



1. Pick the intermediate estimates in the last round you get. Then put it into the parameter file and run remlf90
again.
2. Run airemlf90 with an option to use the EM algorithm as remlf90 does. The option is "OPTION EM-REML 5000" where 5000
is the number of rounds that the EM algorithm is applied to; 5000 is usually enough to get the convergence.
