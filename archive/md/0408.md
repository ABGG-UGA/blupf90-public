## 408: Warning in aireml: G not positive definite: fixed (setup_g)

```
In a model with animal and permanent environment modelled wit a random regression (3rd order polynomial), I get the following error messages:
 G not positive definite: fixed (setup_g) G not positive definite: fixed (setup_g)

followed by
 *** Warning *** corrected Covariance Matrix            5  times



Since I have 2 covariance matrices for the 2 different random regressions, I assume that having 2 warning messages means that both of them are non positive definite. I would like to know whether this could my a mis-parametrisation from my side and if so, how to improve....
