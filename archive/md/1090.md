Dear blupf90 program users,

I would like to announce a new discussion forum for blupf90 programs.
The new forum is "Issues" of the "blupf90-public" repository at Github.

https://github.com/ABGG-UGA/blupf90-public/issues

You can read any posts but need the Github account to submit the issue.
The new repository exclusively hosts the issues, the log of this mailing
list (Yahoo Groups), and useful files.

The new repository is experimental, and we keep this mailing list.
The issue posted in Github may be forwarded to this list if it is
relevant to users.

I hope that the new forum is useful for blupf90 users.

Best regards,

Yutaka Masuda
University of Georgia
