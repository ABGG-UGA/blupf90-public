I would like to convert the FinalReport.txt and SNP_Map.txt files from Genome Studio files suitable for reading with
pregsf90. However, as you can see on the attached file there were no results on both files. By the way the type of
genome here is porcine. Thank you in advance!
Yours truly,Bryan Lopez
