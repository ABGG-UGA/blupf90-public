Hi Ignacio, thank you so much for your reply, actually I am new on this
 software and I need to know how it works, so I tried to run the
 inbupgf90 at first using my pedigree file, I found that the software
 says that there are many duplicated animals ID, so I re-checked my
 pedigree and figured out that this software only reads 16 characters, so
 I opened the read me file for inbupgf90 and it was mentioned that I
 could use larger characters by changing parameter NLEN in the program,
 acually, I don't know were is the parameter NLEN and how can I change
 it? sorry for my long reply.

 Will the binary overcome this issue? if it will, I will be happy if you
 provide it to me, thanks.

 pedigree contains more than 16 characters for an, sire and dam ID so I
 need to raise it from 16 to 20 in inbupgf90 so how can I do that??
