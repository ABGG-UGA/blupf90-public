Good day,I am trying to run postgibbsf90 in linux but when it has to produce the graphs, it gives me the below error
that there is no default destination.How do I set the default destination?
Choose a graph for samples (= 1) or histogram (= 2); or exit (= 0)lpr: Error - no default destination available.

Kind regards,
Delight
