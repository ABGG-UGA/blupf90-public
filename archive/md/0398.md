I want to model heterogeneous residual variance in a random regression test day model for a single trait. I model the
additive effect with a random regression 3rd order polynomial. Additionally I am modelling a permanent environmental
effect also using a 3rd order polynomial random regression. I do this using remlf90. Now I wonder whether I am using
the same model (but different estimating procedure) when using airemlf90, omitting the the explicit parametrization of
a permanent environmental effect but using the options

OPTION hetres_pos a b c
OPTION hetres_pol initVal_a initVal_c initVal_c


instead. Any help or example parameter files (for similar models) are greatly appreciated! 


Thanks in advance
