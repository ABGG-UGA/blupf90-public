Hello everyone!I am working with calf mortality and I'm trying to estimate maternal permanent environment effect
without considering maternal genetics. The problem is that when running the THRGIBBS, it does not recognize the effect
and appears the following error:"too few or too many numbers for effect 	   5 . Was	      2"

My renum parameter file was: 
DATAFILEsurvival.txtTRAITS7FIELDS_PASSED TO OUTPUT
WEIGHT(S)
RESIDUAL_VARIANCE1.0047EFFECT4 cross alphaEFFECT5 covEFFECT6 covEFFECT1 cross
alphaRANDOManimalOPTIONALmpeFILEpedigree.txt(CO)VARIANCES0.2861(CO)VARIANCES_MPE0.0589OPTION cat 2

and the renf90.par file did not take into consideration the last effect: mpe, and covariance matrix for this effect was
not built: 
# BLUPF90 parameter file created by RENUMF90DATAFILE renf90.datNUMBER_OF_TRAITS 	  1NUMBER_OF_EFFECTS	      
5OBSERVATION(S)    1WEIGHT(S) EFFECTS: POSITIONS_IN_DATAFILE NUMBER_OF_LEVELS TYPE_OF_EFFECT[EFFECT NESTED]  2

add_animal    FILErenadd04.ped						      (CO)VARIANCES  0.28610	OPTION cat 2

I don´t know surely if I can estimate the maternal permanent environment effect independently of maternal genetics.
Wheter somebody knows a possible solution I will be very grateful.
