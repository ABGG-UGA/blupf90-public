REML programs can now take advantage of multifrontal sparse matrix package developed by Yutaka Masuda. This requires an
option switch for the YAMS package instead of FSPAK; see Shogo's pages on wiki for details. REML with the new package
is up to 20 times faster in complex models including with the genomic effect and it is more stable. For details on
YAMS, see Masuda et al. in JABG. 
The limit on the number of genotypes in programs online was increased to $10k.
