Hi everyone. I'am estimating (co)variances components and breeding values using THRGIBBS1F90 and GIBBS2F90.The data that
I have contains more than 150.000 animals on pedigree, 70.000 observations for phenotype and 8.000 animals with genomic
information (350.000 SNPs per animal).As you can see, my analysis is taking too much time to finish (1 month with 8
traits analysis, with genomic information, using THRGIBBS1F90). I'am running the BLUP family programs on a server that
have 32 cores (Intel Xeon E5-2630 2.4Ghz; 25GB RAM), but when I do a "htop", I can see that every analysis that I run
only uses 1 core of the processor.Is there anyway that I can use multiple-cores when running THRGIBBS1F90?Or other
solutions to run faster analysis?Thanks!
