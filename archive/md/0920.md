Hi everyone.I'am estimating (co)variances components and breeding values using THRGIBBS1F90 and GIBBS2F90.The data that I have contains more than 150.000 animals on pedigree, 70.000 observations for phenotype and 8.000 animals with genomic information (350.000 SNPs per animal).As you can see, my analisys is tooking too much time to finish (1 month with 8 traits analisys, with genomic information, using THRGIBBS1F90).I'am running the BLUP familiy programs on a server that have 32 cores (Intel Xeon E5-2630 2.4Ghz; 25GB RAM), but when I do a "htop", I can see that every analisys that I run only uses 1 core of the processor.Is there anyway that I can use multiple-cores when running THRGIBBS1F90?Or other solutions to run faster analisys?Thanks!
