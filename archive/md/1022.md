Hi Stefano,
I can not see your screenshot so I just assume that the program just stops after showing the message "hashing tables
for effects set up".


Please tell me the output of the command ulimit -s in your shell. If it shows "unlimited", the program comes from your
data or possible bug of the program. If it shows a number, you type ulimit -s unlimited in your shell and run renumf90
again.
