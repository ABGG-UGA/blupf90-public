Is the inflation similar in BLUP?

 In a two trait analysis, when one trait has very little information, nearly all information for that trait is from
covariances with the other trait. So GEBV for that trait is a small fraction of information form that trait, and a
large fraction from the correlated trait. Then, the correlations of (G)EBV across traits will be very high. 
 Another possibility is too high of a correlations.

Â Hello,
 I have been running a two-trait analysis with an indicator trait and a carcass trait which should be correlated. I
have been using blupf90 with 8,000 genotyped individuals with a two-generation pedigree for about half of the
population. In total there are around 16,000 animals in the analysis.Â 
 The result of the two-trait analysis gives a breeding value estimate that appears inflated compared to the breeding
value produced from running each trait separately in GBLUP. The inflation appears to be around a 5-fold increase.Â 
 I have experimented with changing the alpha/beta and omega/tau values, but this does not appear to change the result
much.
 Is this inflation phenomenon a concern?
 Thanks,
 Justin
