The blank line between the (CO)VARIANCES value of 10 and the OPTION alpha size 90 may be the problem.

 Hi All,

I tried to fit CG as random effect in univariate analysis for weaning weight and my data file (sire WW CG1 PWG CG2)
using parameter file as follow:
 ##################################
DATAFILE
 WWPWGdata6
NUMBER_OF_TRAITS
	    1
NUMBER_OF_EFFECTS
	   2
OBSERVATION(S)
    2
WEIGHT(S)


EFFECTS: POSITIONS_IN_DATAFILE NUMBER_OF_LEVELS TYPE_OF_EFFECT[EFFECT NESTED]
   3	 13058 cross # HYS
  1	20568 cross # sire
RANDOM_RESIDUAL VALUES
  529.7
  RANDOM_GROUP
     2
 RANDOM_TYPE
 add_sire
 FILE
 pedsireVC
(CO)VARIANCES
  48.42
 RANDOM_GROUP
     1
  RANDOM_TYPE
 diagonal
 FILE


(CO)VARIANCES
 10


OPTION alpha size 90
#######################################
 what should I change in the parameter file to fit CG correctly as random effect?
