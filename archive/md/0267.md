 First thought is that to predict, I would use blupf90 with variance components estimated with airemlf90. Le 13/03/2014

 Dear all,

 I am interested in regularly introducing individuals with missing values in their traits, in order to get estimates
for their effects and to be able to perform prediction.
 Using 0 for missing values seems to work fine, but airemlf90 warns rather eloquently that this records should be
omitted from the dataset:
 ** WARNING: All traits are missing; eliminate such records! line=  xx
 
 I have two questions in this regard:

 1. Is there a problem with this procedure? If not, why airemlf90 issues such a scary warning?

 2. I can get a prediction of the phenotype of an unobserved individual just by adding up all the corresponding
effects.
 But, is there a way to compute the prediction error as well?

 Thank you
	 Facundo.-
