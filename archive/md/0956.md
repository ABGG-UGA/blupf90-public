```
First, you showed us the parameter file for renumf90. We need to see a parameter file for thrgibbs1f90 ("renf90.par" if
you use the output file from renumf90).Second, renumf90 doesn't work with the sire model option although you can still
use a sire model applying an animal model. I don't know why you want to use sire model instead of animal model.
Third, You need at least an intercept (mu) or another fixed effect in your model because 2 regressions (linear and
quadratic) don't have the intercept.
Fourth, you can run postgibbsf90 with "OPTION se_covar_function xxxx" to calculate posterior mean and SD for
heritability (see our website or blupf90 manual for detail).
