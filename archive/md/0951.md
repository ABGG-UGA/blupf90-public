When you run our Gibbs programs, you should use "OPTION fixed_var mean" with estimated (co)variance components in your
parameter file after finishing variance component estimation. Usually, 10000 samples with 1000 burn-in is enough to get
posterior means of all solutions.Â You will get "final_solutions".
