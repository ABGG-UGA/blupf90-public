Please help, I would like to run a bivariate 
 RR analysis. Data is test day milk yield for same cow for parity 1,2 and 3. fixed effects are ageclass of calving and
year-season of test, which are different for each parity. How do I arrange the data? The example I saw for dairymt.par
had same fixed effects for both traits. 

 Regards
 Thomas
