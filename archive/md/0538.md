  Â Hello allI just wondering whether would be wrong one gibbs sampling in which the number of levels in the parameter
file is larger than actual number of levels of a given random factor. Â Why am I asking this: Imagine you want to
analyze a subset of your sample, and when you take the subset a part of the litters are discarded. The format of the
new subset data will be the same as the original but the number of levels of some factors might be different, can you
still using the same parameter file as for the original data set? 

 It is my understanding that yes. Solutions for "void" levels will oscillate around 0 (they are sampled from the
prior), and this will not affect the posterior, although the mixing will be slow.

Or in the contrary you have to recode everything so that the levels go from 1 to n without missing levels, and
providing in a new parameter file the correct number of actual levels. Â Thank youJuan Pablo Â	Â  Â Juan Pablo
