Dear all,
I want to use postGSf90 for a GWAS analysis. I understood that including OPTION which_weight w in the parameter file I
obtain the SNP weights for the next iteration round. However, in Wang et al. (2012) and Wang et al. (2014), there is an
additional step of normalization of SNP weights (to remain the total genetic variance constant). How this normalization
is made? Is there an option on postGSf90 for that?
Any help will be appreciate!
Best regards,Juliana Petrini.
