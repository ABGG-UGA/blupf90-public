You should not see only one or tow samples. You need to calculate the posterior mean for residual at convergence using
many (1000 - 100000?) Â independent samples. The mean should be close to 1.0 (could be 0.999 or 1.001). If you always
want to see residual = 1 every round, you can use thrgibbs1f90b. This program may reach the convergence faster. But you
don't have to see residual = 1 for each sample.After running many rounds (e.g., 10000 or 100000), if you still have the
posterior mean for residual variance very far from 1.0, your model is not good or you have not reached the convergence
yet.
