Dear all, Thanks for having this group. I analyzed my data using BLUPf90.The quality control I performed is using the
option of the programme. I have a question on hardy Weinberg equilibrium(hwe).I used this argument to perform hwe
test:OPTION hwe 0.15 The reviewers asked me what is the chi-square value and p-Value for your hwe test?
 Could you please give me possible answer? Thanks so muchWith best regards,Jegna
