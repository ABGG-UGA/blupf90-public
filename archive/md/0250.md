```
I have a simple model with 4 effects (2 random including diagonal and add_animal) and 16 traits. The same parameter file, data file, pedigree file work with REMLF90 and AIREMLF90 and I want to compare to GIBBS, but using the same parameter files etc with GIBBS restuls in an error, although differen for each GIBBS program For GIBBS2 I get forrtl severe list-directed I/O syntax error, unit 50 file ...globalr, which is my data file GIBB1 complains  * Start Gibbs iteration02-10-2014  13h 22m 27s 263
 All traits are missing; eliminate such records!
Any ideas?  I assumed that if it works with REMLF90 and AIREMLF90 that the data and parameter files are OK Bill
