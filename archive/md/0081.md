I know that won't be an easy work. In Dr Misztal's (1997) paper presented the recurrence equation for parental dominance. Latter, Lutaaya's (2002) paper dominance effect was still considered but not in Birgit (2007) or Saskia's (2012) papers. 

 So I wonder whether the program RENDOM still there and can be applied.
