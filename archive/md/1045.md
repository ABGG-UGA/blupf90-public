Hi,I have a doubt on how to calculate heritability for multi trait model (with phenotype, pedigree and genotype
data)for single trait model I was using genetic variance and residual variance obtained from aireml log file.while
running multi trait model  genetic and residual variance matrix are generated in aireml log file.
Please help me, I am new with Animal breeding.
