All,

When I download the program I get this error message when I try to run it. I'm running OSX 10.9.4. 
Mon Aug 18 08:18 AM austinputz: ~/Downloads $ ./airemlf90
dyld: Library not loaded: libiomp5.dylib
  Referenced from: /Users/austinputz/Downloads/./airemlf90
  Reason: image not found
Trace/BPT trap: 5


Can anyone help me with this or have seen the same message?

Thanks for your help.

Austin
