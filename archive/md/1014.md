Dear Shogo,

Thank you very much for your explanation.


I updated the (co)variance matrices of my parameter file, the differences between three runs of 10,000 iterations and
1,000 burn-in ( but stored all sample, stored every 10th samples and stored every 20th samples) is around 1%. So I
think it is good enough for estimating the EBVs. 


On the other hand, I have tried to test THRGIBBS1F90 (with the (co)variance fixed) with 10,000; 100,000 and 1 million
iterations with 10% burn-in. The solutions I had for the fixed effects are fluctuated while the solutions of random
effects are quite stable. For example, the solution of one fixed effect changed from 3.01 to -5.89 while the biggest
change of random effect was from 0.18 to 0.22. In this case, is it normal or it also indicates that (co)variance
components used in the parameter file are not good enough?


Many thanks,
Tuan
