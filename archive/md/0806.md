The SNP file must be formatted to the write side, if you are using are, this should work:

write.fwf(SNP_File, "Name_File", rownames=F, colnames=F, quote=F, justify="right", width=c(max(nchar(IDs)), n_of_SNP))

Or you can use

variable=`awk '{ if (length($1) > max) max = length($1) } END { print max }' SNPfile.txt`
awk '{printf("%'"$variable"'s%1s%" length($2) "s\n",$1," ",$2)}' SNPfile.txt > file && mv file SNPfile.txt
```
