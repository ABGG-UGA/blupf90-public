Hello fellow users,
I would like to know if you encountered an issue similar when runing renumf90 to the one showed in the attached file.


The issue is a strange one as I verified, there is no duplicate either in my genotyping files, pedigree files or data
files...


So, I would like to know your insight on the matter.


Best regards,
Recoquillay Julien.
