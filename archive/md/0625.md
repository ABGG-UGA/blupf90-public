 No it is not. There is a statement for that in airemlf90:
 OPTION se_covar_function
 check the first example in

covariance matrices." Proc. Assoc. Advmt. Anim. Breed. Genet. Vol. 20. 2013.

Â Dear all,
  I am a new user of BLUPf90.I run basic animal model with cage as random effect.I got three variance components with
their standard error : cage , genetic plus residual.However, I didn't get standard error for the phenotype variance.
 Is the standard error for the phenotype variance is the sum of the standard error of 
cage , genetic plus residual ? If not how can I calculate it ?Thanks 
 With best regards, jegna
