Shogo,


Is the example below right? 


Header of Data file: ID t1 CG1 t2 CG2


if the effects in the parameter file were:

CG1:  
3 0   100 cross


CG2:
0 5   200 cross


Direct:
1 1   10000 cross


then the degree of belief:


OPTION prior 0 0 3 4
zeros for fixed effects, 3 for direct genetic and 4 for residual


Thanks,
Hamad
