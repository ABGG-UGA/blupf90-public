   Hi all Working with remlf90 we were trying to estimate covariances in a MT model but keeping constant the variances,
thus we used the OPTION constant_var.  On this regard we would like to comment two issues  1.- We observed that
although the estimates reach stationary values the convergence criteria was not meet, thus we changed the convergence
criteria to be function only of those variance components that will be estimated. We did in this way:	 call
setup_g_noprint  g_conver=g  newg_conver=newg  r_conver=r  newr_conver=newr	where (g_const)      newg_conver=0     
 g_conver=0   end where     where (r_const)	 newr_conver=0	     r_conver=0   end where   if(gpar > 0) then     
conv = (sum((newg_conver-g_conver)**2))/sum(newg_conver**2) + (sum((newr_conver-r_conver)**2))/sum(newr_conver**2)  
else	  conv = (sum((newr_conver-r_conver)**2))/sum(newr_conver**2)	endif	print*,' In round ',round,'
convergence=',conv     ! set some variances to constant values	 where (g_const)      newg=g   end where   where
(r_const)      newr=r  end where   g=newg   r=newr  I.E.: After defining arrays for saving the VC matrices in the
current and in the previous iteration. And setting to zero those VC which are constrained.  Do you think this is right?

 It looks good to me...
  2.- The other issue I would like to share with you is related to the way we computed de ErrorsTo get standard error
for the estimated correlations, as AIREML does not implement the option  constant_var, we decided to run just 1
iteration of airemlf90 and by using the OPTION se_covar_function get computed of the SD of the sampling distribution of
the correlations. In only one (non constrained) iteration no big changes with respect to the EMREML estimates were
observed but some different exist, that way we are not sure about this way to get the errors. What do you think about
this? Are you aware about any other option to get the errors of the correlations when the variances are constrained?



 there must be some approximation involved. For instance the s.e. of the correlation will include the s.e. of the
variances and of the covariances. A more exact way would be to make 0 the elements of the AI "information matrix"
corresponding to fixed variances (but not the covariances), although I bet that this will yield a non positive definite
AI information matrix.

 Another manner to get the s.e. is to simulate, say 100 times, data under the estimated parameters, estimate
covariances, (100 estimates for each covariance, thus) and then compute the s.e. of these estimated parameters. You can
do this using EMREML but it will be long.

 Munilla & Cantet have a paper (conjugate wishart or something like that) where they can put different prior variances
on different components. I wonder if this is what you need.
