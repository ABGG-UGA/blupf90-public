Dear all,

I was trying to estimate SNP effects for honey bees with the BLUPf90 software. Our model contains direct and maternal
effects. My problem is that I need to use my own numerator relationship matrix. BLUPf90 seemed to ignore the SNP file,
when I provided it with the numerator relationship matrix, so I checked preGSf90 and got the following error message:

 unimplemented random type	     8

Is the feature I wanted to use supported or did I make a mistake?

I called preGSf90 with something like the following line. The files mentioned are provided as attachments.

echo parameters_12.txt | /home/.../preGSf90 | tee preGSf90_12.log

Thank you in advance.
With best regards,
Richard Bernstein
