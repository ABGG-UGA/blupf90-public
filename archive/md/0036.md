Dear all. This is my first post. Am excited to join this network. 
 My problem is a bit basic. I would like to run a bivariate sire model for milk yield between a nucleus and the
commercial population. The examples i see on BLUPF90 have a somewhat different data structure. i.e. the traits are
measured at the same time. in my case they are measured in different herds and years. Any one with an idea how I can
handle this?
 The available examples look like: sire fixed effect trait 1 trait2

 my data is: sire1 environment 1 trait1 
 sire1 environment 2 trait 2 
 please help
