Dear all,Â Thanks for having this group.Â I analyzed my data using BLUPf90.The quality control I performed is using the
option of the programme.Â I have a question on hardy Weinberg equilibrium(hwe).I used this argument to perform hwe
test:OPTION hwe 0.15Â The reviewers asked me what is the chi-square value and p-Value for your hwe test?
 You cannot compute them from blupf90. You may compute it yourself from your data. It is a chi-squared table with
observed and expected based on frequencies.
 Also you have a test for each marker.

Â Could you please give me possible answer?Â Thanks so muchWith best regards,Jegna
