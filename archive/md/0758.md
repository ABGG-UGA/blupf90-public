Thank you for your answer.
I tried suppress the Option solution and/or fixed var. The results were that it was when using the fixed var option
that the gibbs_samples was not edited.

I would like to know if I understood the ways of thrgibbs :
-In normal times, thrgibbs gives the solution in the binary_solutions file that is -at least for me- unreadable.
-Using the OPTION solution allows to have the solutions to be written in more friendly format.
-Using the OPTION fixed var is for using the threshold model without re-estimating the variance of the traits with the
help of the gibbs sampler.

Am I correct or completely and foolishly on the wrong ?

Thank you again for your kind answer.
