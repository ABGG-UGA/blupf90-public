There is an option for estimating SE for functions of variances:

OPTION se_covar_function <label> <function>
For heritability, for example:
OPTION se_covar_function H2d G_2_2_1_1/(G_2_2_1_1+G_2_3_1_1+G_3_3_1_1+G_4_4_1_1+R_1_1)

where direct additive effect is number 2 and maternal is effect number 3. You have to modify this function to be adequate to your model.

Â Hi,Â 
How can I calculate the standard errors of heritability using AIREMLF90?The program (AIREMLF90) has already shown the standard error of the variances.I'm doing one trait analysis and wanted to calculate the standard error of heritability?
kind regards
