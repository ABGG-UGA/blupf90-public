Hi abdalkhateb,
If you are not familiar with Gibbs sampling, please read a textbook or start with popular articles for Bayesian
statistics and Gibbs sampling e.g. Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibbs_sampling). The "interval", which you
have to type-in as the 3rd number, is known as thinning. The optimal numbers of samples, burn-in, and thinning most
likely depend on your data and model.
