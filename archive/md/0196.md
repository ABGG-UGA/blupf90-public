```
solutions file contains all the solution estimates for all effects
regular solutions file contains 4 columns1 trait
2 effect
3 level
4 solution
( if OPTION sol se  column #5  SE) 


in your case effect 4 (renadd04.ped) so you need to extract rows for col2==4 from the solutions files


for example using the following command in a unix terminal: 


awk '$2==4' solutions  > newfile

Hi Everybody, 

 

After running airemlf90, i noticed that the file SOLUTIONS and the file RENADD04.PED  contains different number of rows.
Is that correct?
