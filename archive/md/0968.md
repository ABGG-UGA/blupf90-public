Hi allÂ 

I have been using blupf90 family programs for sometime. In our fish breeding programs, we often need to estimate
variance due to common environmental effect by fitting family ( or family tank) as random effect in addition to animal
( or sire or dam) as random.Â 


Can anyone please tell if this is possible? I know there is an OPTION pe, mpe etc in blupf90 but this is Â not a
solution to my question.Â 


Thanks
