Good afternoon from São Paulo- Brazil. 
My name is Natalia Marín (M.Sc student in Genetics and Animal Breeding). 
I am working with a categorical trait (specifically pre-weaning mortality in Nelore calves which has a binary respond).
I was trying to estimate variance components through sire model using THRGIBBSF90, and I included the effect of
contemporary groups (CG) as random besides of two covariates within the vector of fixed effects (age of dam at calving
including linear and quadratic effects), and of course the additive genetic of sire. 
My pedigree file, in this case, is in the structure as named in the blupf90 manual, containing sire's ID/ sire's sire's
ID- and sire's maternal grand sire's-ID.   (Co)variances in the parameter file for the two random effects were set up
in 1.000. However, at the end of the analysis, I obtained only two variance components (and I supposed to obtain three:
genetic, contemporary group and residual variances).  As you can see below, it seems like the program is considering
the effect located in the position of the contemporary group's effect instead of the sire's, because CG is the fourth
effect in the parameter file, and the G matrix resulting is for effect 4 and not for the effect of the sire's that is
the third named in parameter file. 
The thrgibbsf90 output file shows the following: * End of iteration08-17-2018  16h 40m 29s 317

As well as the postmean file (after running postgibbsf90) : 
G matrix for effect =		4  0.39982     R matrix  0.99965    


- Firstly I would like to ask what could be causing this problem?, why can't I estimate variance component for
contemporary groups?-In addition, I would like to know if the genetic variance component estimated through sire model
actually corresponds to the sire's additive genetic variance or if that variance is already transformed to direct
additive genetic variance (0.25* sire's variance). - Is there any OPTION to put in the parameter file to estimate
heritability? 
The parameter file used is the following:
DATAFILEpreM.txt					     #phenotypic data fileTRAITS7			       
			  #position of trait mortalityFIELDS_PASSED TO OUTPUT
WEIGHT(S)
RESIDUAL_VARIANCE1.0000 					   #residual variance set up in 1.00EFFECT5 cov

# Position of contemporary groupRANDOM diagonal 					 # Effect of contemporary group

			    # mortality as binary trait

 I would like to thank you for the time to read my questions. So far I'm a beginner user of blupf90 family programs. 
Best regards.
