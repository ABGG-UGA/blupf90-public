Hi Andres,

I have started aireml from a converged remlf90 (EM) run with the option EM-REML 10. so the initial values are fine. I
have a small data set and saw that the covariance matrix at a convergence criterion 10^-8 are vastly different from
what I get at 10^-10. Basically, I do not trust the results I get from the remlf90 run. that is why I started an aireml
run. 


thanks Chris
