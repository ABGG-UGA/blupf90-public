Thank Andres, Youâ€™re so kind for helping me.

I have some questions about the variances.
With THRGIBBS1F90 , for one Binary trait analysis with only animal model,
From another program I have the variance for animal effect is 0.895993E-03 and 0.449822E-01 for the residual variance.
So I put these values into the parameter file with the hope that these can be the good stater values for the GIBBS
SAMPLING process.
I put them as
.....
RANDOM_RESIDUAL VALUES 
0.449822E-01 

RANDOM_GROUP
7
 RANDOM_TYPE
 add_animal
 FILE
pedi.prn
 (CO)VARIANCES
0.895993E-03
I noticed that when the program ran, the residual random variance was around 1.
SO, it is quite different with what I set up in RANDOM_RESIDUAL VALUES. Is it correct when I assign 0.449822E-01 for
RANDOM_RESIDUAL VALUES?


On the other hand, for one binary trait with 2 random effects analysis with the part of the parameter as



RANDOM_GROUP
7 8
 RANDOM_TYPE
 add_animal
 FILE
pedi.prn
 (CO)VARIANCES
0.3110	    0.00000000
0.0000	    0.5033E-02

 


Cause I did not know the covariance between the two effects, so I put 0 as the starter values. Will THRGIBBS1F90
understand  0.00000 as stater values or it understands that there is no correlation between the two effects?


Can anyone help me with these?
Thank you very much
