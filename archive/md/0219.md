I think that this should be accommodated setting to zero effects for particular traits 


11 11 15927 cov 7 7  # linear for both traits
12 12	15927 cov 7 7 # second covariate both trait
13 0   15927 cov 7 0 # ...
14 0   15927 cov 7 0 # ...
15 0   15927 cov 7 0 # ...
11 11 15927 cov 8 8 # maternal first covariate for both traits. assuming column 8 is the dam 
12 0   15927  cov 8 0 
....
15 0 ....


Then in RANDOM_GROUP put the 10 effects and so covariance matrix. 


the size of your covariance matrix will be 20 x 20, i.e. 10 random correlated effects (5 effects direct + 5 effects
maternal) times  2 traits.  with zeros for the 


Setting pe and maternal pe in similar way 


have you tried Renumf90 ?
this is how to setup a random regression effect(s) for direct, maternal, maternal_pe and permanent-direct for 3
covariates and 9 traits.

Then you need to edit and set to zero some covariates for each trait 
the covariance matrix in this case will be 54 x 54 (6 random correlated effects (3 direct and 3 maternal) times  9
traits.

Dear all,



I am trying to fit a random regression model with two traits (weigth and tick cattle). My random effects are additive
direct and permanent environmental for both traits and for weight, I have more random effects: the maternal and
maternal permanent environmental. 


For weigth, in a previous analysis a fourth order (Legendre) was indicated dor additive effect and for tick cattle the
linear (Legendre) was suggested. I would like to obtain the covariances between these traits.


I tried it:
Position data file, Number of levels, type, nested
11 0 15927 cov 7 0
12 0 15927 cov 7 0
13 0 15927 cov 7 0
14 0 15927 cov 7 0
15 0 15927 cov 7 0
0 11 15927 cov 0 7
0 12 15927 cov 0 7


however it did not work (error reading variances for effect 5)


Could you hel p me to fit this model to obtain the covariance between these traits?


With regards,
