 You need an extra effect to account for the permanent effect.
 You can either create an extra column in data file with the "repeated" effects or use the same column as "animal" itself.
 This should work (see changes below).:

 Hi everyone,

 I was trying to fit a three trait repeatability model in BLUPF90, but I
 don't quite understand how to set up the parameter file correctly. I was
 looking at some of the example in the wiki page, but I am not sure on
 how to do it. I have three traits con columns 4 5 6, and I have three
 effects, random animal effect on column 1 and two fixed effects on
 columns 2 and 3. The number of observations (repeated measures) for each
 animal varies between 2 and 6, and some animals just have one
 observation (is that going to be a problem?). Also I have a pedigree
 with 2025 individuals. So far this is what I was doing, but it's not
 working. I would appreciate any help or hint.

 Regards,

 Napo V.
