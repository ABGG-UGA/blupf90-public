HiI'm running GWAS single-step analysis using the BLUPf90 family programs and I have two problems:1 - I perform the
iteration to step 1 and step 2 without the problem.When I run AIREMLF90 or REMLF90 for step 3, it not converge. So, I
decrease the convergence criterion and the analysis converges but the variances are lower than in step 2.   2 - Another
problem I'm having is to run binary traits with the thrgibbsf90.The Iterations 1 and 2 perform correctly.In iteration
3, the analyse stopped and the following information is reported:"qform not pos def, fixed   Matrix not
semipositive-definite, row 1"I tried changing the first guess of the variances several times, but I still have the same
problem.  Has anyone had these problems and can you help me?Thank you very much
