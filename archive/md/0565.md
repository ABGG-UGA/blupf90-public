Thanks Daniela and Andres, this is exactly what I was looking for.

If I may comment, this seems like a somewhat wasteful way to write a dense symmetric matrix. Instead of 4 or 8 bytes
for each coefficient  this way adds 8 bytes for i and j and either 8 or 16 bytes for the Fortran start and end of
record markers, thereby inflating the file size by up to 3-5 times the minimum needed. It seems to me that it would be
considerably more efficient to just write the matrix as a half-stored vector in a single write statement. 

Of course for learning and experimenting with small to moderate datasets simplicity is a more important factor than
efficiency, so keep up the good work and thanks for these great tools.

Gerald
