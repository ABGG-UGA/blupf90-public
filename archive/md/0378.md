Hi All,
I'm trying to compare threshold vs linear model (thrgibbs1f90).   cross validation requires setting part of the data to
be missing, but in case of univariate model it wouldn't work (because I have only one trait and some animal don't have
observations).my purpose is estimating breeding values not variance.
I understand that in order to use thrgibbs1f90, at least one trait should has an observation.
I don't know what to do. any suggestions?  
Thanks 
Hamad Saad
