Hello,

I want to analyze two traits, one has repeated measurements (using RRM with heterogeneous residual), the other just has single measurements. the data looks like this 


But I found that residual for the 2nd trait is also 0 in different gibbs rounds. and when I simplified the RRM to homogeneous residual, residuals for both traits are 0. Does anyone know what's wrong in my parameter file? The parameter file is also attached.

Thanks,Tong
