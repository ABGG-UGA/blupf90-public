Hello good morning everyone and Dr. Tsuruta,


    I was able to get the Breeding Values for "final_solutions", but I'm having trouble understanding which drive in
the "final_solutions" file for Breeding Values. Do they come in percentage, or unit characteristics? The values in the
file "final_solutions" for Breeding Values ranged from -2, .. to 2, .. (in the least characteristic), .. -10, .. to 10,
.. (in the most characteristic).
    My data relate to horse racing, we created a rank of minimo 1 and a maximum of 5 to rank the horses within each
race, and we used four different distances, in multi-characteristics.


Thank you very much for your attention and a good week.
Ricardo Faria
