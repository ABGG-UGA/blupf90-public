You should use "OPTION solution mean" or "OPTION fixed_var mean". "OPTION solution mean" will sample variances and solutions at the same time and save "final_solutions". But to run with "OPTION solution mean", you have to know the burn-in before running. On the other hand, "OPTION fixed_var" will not estimate variances but solutions using known variances specified in your parameter file. So, you should not run thrgibbs1f90 with both options at the same time.

I recommend that you should run thrgibbs1f90 without those options first and run postgibbsf90 to estimate variances and then using those estimated variances, run with "OPTION fixed_var mean" to estimate posterior means and SD for solutions.
