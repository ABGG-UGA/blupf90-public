Dear Shogo, 

Thank you very much for your explanations.


For the problem with OPTION prior, after I ran the program, typed the name of a parameter file, there were couple of running lines, the black window then just disappeared. It was really fast, I could not see if there was any error message.


As I described before, when I did not include the degree of belief for residual variance, the program was working well. But when I added the degree of belief for residual variance, it did not work.


I got the value 24 from the paper of Roehe et al 2010 about using Bayesian analysis for estimating genetic parameters for piglet survival.


What should I do to include the degree of belief for residual variance?


Many thanks,
Tuan Nguyen
