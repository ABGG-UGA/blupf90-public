Dear group members.I am doing a RRM analysis using AIREMLF90 program. I intend to get the accuracy of the EBV
estimates.But, I am not quite sure how to calculate the "Predicted Error Covariance" from this anlysis outputs. Can
anyone suggest me a way? As of a thought, I assumed that the pev_pec_bf90 file provide me some help. But, the file has
very little documentation as well. Not quite sure what it means. I would appreciate any assistance in this regard. 
Thank you.Lee Seok-Hyun
