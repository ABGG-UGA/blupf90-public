 Perhaps after some modifications for max SNP size but BLUPF90 is not for this. Usually few animals are analyzed with
full sequence data and benefits to GEBV from genomics are small if the number of genotypes is small.Ignacy

 Dear all,

 Is it possible to use blupf90 for a very large data set like millions of SNPs from the sequenced data?

 Best Regards,
