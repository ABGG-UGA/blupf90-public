sisters in God, knowledge, and humanity.I commence my message with a few universal words of the absolute cosmic
knowledge and wisdom that were delivered to the human species more than 2000 years ago by Jesus Christ, and which alone
would bring total peace and happiness in the endless worlds of existence:But I say unto you: love your enemies, bless
them that curse you, do good to them that hate youMy name is Mustafa Salim Dia. I now lead a solitary and poor life in
a small village, located in the district of the city of Tyre, in the South of Lebanon, called Bafley. I am a humble man
of knowledge with no house, no country, no bad self-importance, no personal history, but a life of challenge,
knowledge, and mystery to be lived. I spend my time on the net sending my message of love and peace to the whole
world.I am separated from my two lovely daughters Lydia and Elena who live in the capital city of Beirut with their
mother. They have suffered a great deal of psychological and emotional pain as a consequence of my strange life.
Believe me, it is not easy to have a father with a reputation of being a weirdo nuts and a crazy man. I only hope they
would forgive me when they eventually understand that I was at the mercy of the powers that rule the universe, and had
no way of escaping the designs of Infinity, and the absolute tyranny of my friend death and companion destiny, who were
both stalking me since I was one year old.Death and destiny are the two mysterious forces that God or Infinity use(s)
to implement his or her (neither his nor her) designs in order to bring the origination and evolution of existence into
its destined fates through these two forces, which are manifested in the form of absolutely destined, programmed,
orderly, and extremely precise and calculated (destiny) big bangs, cosmic collisions and blasts, atomic and chemical
reactions, natural catastrophes, volcanic eruptions, geological factors, and other mighty deadly forces of nature
(death).Death and destiny are also sent in the form of horrifying and extremely strenuous events and circumstances to
bring a total change in certain human beings, in order for them to deliver their fellow humans to safety, and raise
their physical and mental survival capabilities by teaching them grand and whole new ways of thinking and living, to
act in the world around them and perceive it in a totally different fashion.I was visited by death and destiny since I
was one year old in the form of extremely horrifying and strenuous events and situations to teach me grand and whole
new ways of thinking and living in order to shatter apart all my previous feelings and perceptions of the world around
me, that were taught to me by society and parents, so I would become void of those old perceptions and feelings to
receive and comprehend new truths and knowledge about existence.Certain truths were revealed to me about the way human
beings perceive and understand the religious nature of existence. I was forced to read all kinds of books in different
religions, philosophies, science, and other human knowledge to understand the way human beings perceive and grasp their
religious, spiritual, and physical world.I would reveal in this message a short and brief account of my strange and out
of the world story with death and destiny. It tells how Infinity deals harshly and mercilessly with a chosen human
being, in order to shatter apart his social self or the ego, by separating all his feelings of bad self-importance from
his feelings of good self-importance, and locking the feelings of bad self-importance deep inside himself with the help
of his three eternal guardians patience, strong will, and determination.You could never get rid of bad or good
self-importance. They are part of the social being or the ego that grows with time since birth to enhance our raw and
rented awareness into something called the human attention.We are an awareness and feelings. Infinity lends us raw
primitive awareness to develop it through feelings into higher and more enhanced human attentions during the process of
being alive. God The Almighty retrieves back these enhanced awareness after we die. That is the reason behind our
origination: we are organic machines that develop and enhance raw and primitive awareness so Infinity would eventually
retrieve it back as more enhanced attentions for reasons incomprehensible for us. We will never understand the designs
of Infinity.We all love, hate, envy, forgive, and be charitable or greedy. We all have good and bad feelings. They are
what makes us into human beings. We cannot get rid of any of them. We can only make bad self-importance take control,
or let the good self-importance be the dominant force in our lives. But whether the good or bad self-importance takes
the lead, you will still be affected by the members of the other part. Only patience, strong will, and determination
could lock either part inside and let the other partner take control whether it is the good or the bad part.I would
also reveal some new spiritual and religious facts which have been haunting humans since their origination and
evolution on our beloved mother earth. You would understand that the story of Adam and other religious facts were mere
metaphors to teach a lesson. The collective mind of human beings was the factor that determined what stories prophets
and men of knowledge came with. Infinity could not reveal to them, for example, that the universe originated from a big
bang, or humans developed from another species, or life was originated two billion years ago from a single cell. The
collective mind of human beings would not have understood those scientific facts.Although God The Almighty revealed
very clearly the big bang and the expansion of the universe more than 1400 years ago in the Holy Koran, but the
collective mind of human beings was not able to comprehend those scientific facts, because it was not prepared to
accept those Divine Scientific Truths.Do the disbelievers not see that the heavens and the earth were one mass, and We
tore them apart? (Holy Koran - Alanbiya – verse 30)We constructed the universe with power, and we are expanding it
(Holy Koran – the Aldhariyat (the winnowing winds) – verse 47)Now the collective mind of human beings have
developed into a level where it would be easy for us to accept those scientific facts.I would reveal certain Divine
truths about the nature of Infinity or God The Almighty. We can never comprehend the essence of Infinity with our
finite minds. We would only grasp the effects of Infinity, but not its True and Divine essence. Infinity resembles
nothing of what we perceive or feel. It is Indivisible, Incomprehensible, and Infinite One Divine Whole. Our collective
and personal minds can only perceive the finite and limited nature of existence.I would reveal the bad designs of
Infinity and what it has in store for us if we keep on following the path of hatred, envy, and greed.I would also
reveal the good designs of Infinity and what it has in store for us if we traverse the path of love, forgiveness, and
charity.I would divide my message of love and peace into six parts:The Absolute Mystery of ExistenceMy Mysterious Story
with Death and DestinyThe Ultimate Goal of HumanityThe Big Bang, Evolution, and the Real AdamsThe Mysterious Designs of
InfinityJews, Christians, and MuslimsGood luck to you dearest and most beloved brothers and sisters in God, knowledge,
and humanity with your new adventure, on a mysterious journey to the boundaries of the unknown, where you will soar on
the eternal wings of Infinity, to discover a whole new world of mystery and wonder, you have never ever witnessed even
in your wildest imaginations.
