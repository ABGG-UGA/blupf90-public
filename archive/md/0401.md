It depends on what kind of polynomials (functions) you are using. After the convergence, when the number of positions =
the number of initial values (coefficients), you can calculate the heterogeneous residual variance with
V(e)=exp(a1*f(t1)+a2*f(t2)+...) by using the original scale. When the number of positions+1 = the number of
coefficients,Â V(e)=exp(a0+a1*f(t1)+a2*f(t2)+...), where a0 is the intercept and a1, a2, ... are estimates of
coefficients. Off course you can choose different (or no) polynomials for additive, PE, and residual variances.
