Dear all,

 I'm working with six traits and direct and maternal effects. There are 
 signs that the model with all covariances has too many parameters for 
 the quality of data that we have.

 In the literature I found approaches to group traits where the full set 
 of covariances is only applied inside the group, and between the groups 
 there is only a single covariance.

 More specifically, I have 4 traits that should be combined to a 
 "performance index", and 2 other traits to a "disease resistance" index. 
 The covariance of both indeces should be estimated in AIREML and used in 
 BLUP, but not for each performance trait with each resistance trait. I 
 hope this is sufficiently clear.

 Is this also implemented in BLUPF90/(AI)REML90? If so, how to write such 
 a model?

 Thank you,
 Andreas Hoppe



 PS: I apologize if I just have missed it in the documentation.
