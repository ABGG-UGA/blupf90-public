Hi,
You should put an actual, integer number here (like 1, 10, 50, and so on). You put a literal `n`, which is a character,
not a number. Please type 1 here if you are not sure what it is. 



Details: This number is thinning. If you put 1 here, the program saves all samples (every round). If you put 2 here,
for example, the program saves the sample every other round (i.e. saves sample in round 1, 3, 5, etc.). If you put 10
here, the program saves the sample every 10 rounds.This may be useful when you know the samples are highly
auto-correlated AND you want to reduce the disk access and disk storage. The optimal thinning depends on data and model
so, I can not say what is the best number. Please use 1 for the first-time analysis.



Yutaka
