Hi All,

I fitted a sire maternal grand-sire model to estimate sire variance components for calving ease,birth weight, weaning
weight, and yearling weight (using thrgibbs1f90). I calculated their respective direct genetic variance and their
standard deviations (simply by multiplying by 4). My question is how to calculate standard deviation for heritability,
and genetic correlations? is it implemented in thrgibbs1f90? 


Thanks,


Hamad Saad
