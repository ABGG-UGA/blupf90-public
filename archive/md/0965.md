BLUP is based on the base population in A and ssGBLUP is based on the current genotyped animals (as default) in G. So,
the genetic base for ssGBLUP is more recent (especially if animals were genotyped more recently). This is why the mean
of ssGBLUP is lower when there is genetic trend by selection to increase genetic gain. The genetic base in BLUP and
ssGBLUP is different, so comparing the means is meaningless without adjustment of the genetic base.

And you don't need to put 0 for candidates in the data file.
