 You need to use the correct syntax, e.g.
 RANDOM_GROUP
 Â 2
 RANDOM_TYPE
 user_file
 FILE
 Â barley_kin.txt

trying to get Rex Bernardo's classic example of Morex, Robust, Excel, and Stander barley to work in blupf90. This is
from pages 270 to 274 in his textbook "Breeding for Quantitative Traits in Plants". I converted the coefficient of
coancestry from tabular analysis into what I think is the correct format for blupf90:1 1 11 2 0.51 3 0.43751 4 0.343752
1 0.52 2 12 3 0.843752 4 0.6718753 1 0.43753 2 0.843753 3 13 4 0.71093754 1 0.343754 2 0.6718754 3 0.71093754 4 1I
saved this file as "barley_kin.txt" and then added it to the bottom of my parameter file as:"OPTION user_file
barley_kin.txt"
As far as I can tell, the results do not seem to utilize my file in any way. Â Can anyone give me help on this problem?
Â Thank you in advance.Lyle
