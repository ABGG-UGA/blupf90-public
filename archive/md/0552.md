 Pedigree is useful only with phenotypes on ungenotyped animals. Otherwise dummy pedigree.Ignacy

First, thank you for putting together a great set of programs that work very well and for allowing the community to use
them.
 I am currently putting together a genomic evaluation in beef cattle. We have no observed pedigree, but we do parentage
analysis from SNP data to create one. Some animals (10%) do not get assigned parentage, but are still useful through
the genomic relationship matrix. 
Any thoughts on how this affects GBLUP? I do not think we are adding information to the analysis by putting in
parentage that is observed in the genomic relationship matrix. Would we be better off just putting in a dummy pedigree?
Something like

Thank you for your time.
