 Hi,

 with the latest versions of (ai)remlf90.exe (both 32 and 64 bits), I'm getting an error about a missing libiomp5md.dll
library.

 I have tested on Windows 7 64 bits and on Windows XP 32 bits (only the 32 bit version).

 On the other hand, on one Win7 64bit box with the Intel Fortran compiler installed, they worked fine.

 Æ’acu.-
