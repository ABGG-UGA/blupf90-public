 No, I can't. This is a forum, not a consultancy office.
 You must understand that renumf90 generates a *suggestive* renf90.par file. But you can modify it as you wish. So you
can declare an effect as fixed, for instance, and then change it to user_file. 
 You can also renum with your own tools (for a small example you can do it straight)

Â This looks like the syntax that renumf90.exe generates after I feed it my original parameter file. Â I tried altering
the renf90.par file that renumf90.exe generates to match the syntex you suggested above, but it doesn't work. Can you
suggest changes to my original parameter file that I feed into renumf90.exe? I have attached my documents above.Lyle
