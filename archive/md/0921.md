The file "pev_pec_bf90" has several columns: the 1st one is the level (renumbered animal id for additive genetic effect) and the rest is the elements of PEC matrix. For example, assuming two random-regression coefficients for the effect (i.e. the covariance matrix is 2x2), the first some lines in "pev_pec_bf90" look like this:

         1   5.8369       0.83505        1.5948    
         2   5.8139       0.82020        1.7337    
         3   5.4854       0.78362        1.4231    
         4   2.8115       0.38416       0.89212    
         5   5.9780       0.84527        1.7787    


The matrix is symmetric so only the lower or upper elements are stored. In above example, animal 1 has the PEV matrix (say T) like 


      5.8369      0.8351
      0.8351      1.5948


and you can calculate pev/pec (prediction error variance and covariances) using it with a coefficient matrix P


PEC = P * T * P'


like computations of variance components in random-regression model (see p.82 of https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1439-0388.2003.00444.x where you can replace Ti with above T).
