Ok, but first line says: "Binaries for Linux, Windows and Mac areÂ here."

If you click link "here" you get the .dms files, no progsf90.tar.gz.


Below that:
Older versions are available as Fortran 95Â package




Clicking the link "package" gives you progsf90.tar.gz. But does this mean only the older version is available?


Thanks!Â

Dear all,
I have a problem with obtaining progsf90 in the first place.Â 
I feel a bit like I am missing something, but perhaps there is a real problem on the website.Â 


Links to download the BLUPF90 and related programs point here:Â http://nce.ads.uga.edu/ html/projects/programs/


The Readme in that directory says you can simply install by doing, e.g.Â tar xzvf progsf90.tar.gz


That would be fine, but I don't see a progsf90.tar.gz. In addition, within each directory, e.g. under Mac_OSX/ each
individual program comes with some extension *.dms I've never seen beforeand can't seem to track down. 


Mac OS X 10.12.6. Command line tools and gfortran installed.


Please can someone help to set me straight or point me in the right direction?


Thanks so much,


Marnin
