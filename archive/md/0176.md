 It is hard to tell without more information and in particularly how the two sets of individuals are related.
 If your 700 individuals are the parents of the 32000 thousands the answer is yes. If the 700 individuals are little
related the answer is no.

 You can always run the two cases and check how does it look.

   Dear all,
 I would like to know if the number of genotyped animals are not many (let's say 700 animals), but the number of
phenotypes are many (~ 32000), is it a suitable number for doing GWAS using blupf90. Since blupf90 can use the
information of non-genotyped animals for association. However, I am not sure if the number of genotyped animals are
enough in this case for capturing the variation in situation when all phenotypes are used?

 Regards,
 Marzieh
