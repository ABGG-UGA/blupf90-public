I thought you were using thrgibbs1f90. That's why I asked if it's categorical.

Still you may need to rescale the observations. The reason is our Gibbs sampling programs are using single precision and can't handle large-scale observations as mentioned before.


Another problem may be that you don't have a fixed effect. You need at least one fixed effect (could be mean).
