Hi Babak,
The source code is available at http://nce.ads.uga.edu/~ignacy/numpub/dominance/ which is Ignacy's original repository.
Windows binary is available at the same location. For Linux binary, please check
http://nce.ads.uga.edu/html/projects/programs/Linux/Temp/ . No Mac binary is available but you can compile the source
code.
