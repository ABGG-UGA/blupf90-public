Dear Ignacy Misztal

I am trying to run pregsf90 for a trait with n= 2200 and SNP = ~ 50000. The order I run was
pregsf90 > blupf90 or airemlf90 > postgsf90

The steps of pregsf90 and blupf90 running properly without any error. However,	I am unable to get output from
postgsf90, though it runs and stops at the step : 

*------------------------*
* Setup Genomic Done !!! *
*------------------------*

Solutions read from file: "solutions"

. ( I have followed all the steps from the manual properly). Connected to this I have following questions:

1. Is it mandatory to have mapfile for the postgsf90 option? (OPTION chrinfo). If so, I presume the mapfile should be
ordered by Chromosome number and Map position. Also, the order of SNPs in the SNP file must be the as in the Map file?

2. If we dont need Mapfile, why its stopping without giving any error messages?, What I can do to improve my analysis?

Note: SNP coding followed as : 0= AA, 1= AB, 2=BB and NA=5
