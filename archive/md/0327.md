Â Dear Andr,So thanks for your cooperation. I try by this code (./gibbs3f90) more time, but it was useless. By typing this code the following error appears:
: Permission denied
I worked later by Kernal Linux 2.6. This code in that version of Linux correctly carried out. But now i have access only Ubuntu 13.10 version.


Thanks again
