 Dear all,

 Is it possible to impose linear constraints (e.g. Ax=0) to random effects?

 More specifically, I might be interested in using user_file to fit a random effect with an improper covariance matrix.
 For example, the Random Walk of first order is commonly used as a non-parametric univariate effect.
 It is a gaussian random effect with a covariance matrix with a rank deficiency of 1. i.e. the likelihood is the same
up to a constant.
 The common approach with these models is to impose a sum-to-zero constraint.
 In this way they are perfectly indentified.

 Is it possible to do so?

 thanks again
