Dear all,
I am planning to fit an single-step animal model that incorporates 2 animal genetic effects. For instance, this animal effects would use different genomic relationship matrices.
I was wondering whether this can be done easily or not. What seems hard to me is to specify different relationship matrices of SNP files.
Appreciate your help,
Francesco T.
