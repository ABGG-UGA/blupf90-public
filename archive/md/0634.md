  Â Dear all,
Â Â 

I need to remove or reduce co-variance matrix (A matrix) to change correlated random effect to uncorrelated random effect (only for progeny) . How do I change A*Ïƒ_u^2 Â to I*Ïƒ_u^2 ? Can I analyze my data with BLUPF90 package and subtract dependent variable of solution.Â 
 

 


Thanks,

Hossein
