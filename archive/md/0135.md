 Yes, but this is not automatic or by default. I suggest:
 1) use inbupgf90. This gives inbreeding coefficients
 2) compute from this the coefficients for the inverse. The exact formula can be found here (page 3):

 3) recreate your pedigree file in the format add_an_upginb (see pdf above for such format).

 Hello everyone,

 I would like to know if the F90 Family of programs consider inbreeding when calculating the inverse of relationship matrix. Thank you for answer this simple question.
