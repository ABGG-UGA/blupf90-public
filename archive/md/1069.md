Dear all, I am using preGSf90 for simulations where I was planning to calculate the genomic relationship matrix for up
to 36000 animals, but I could not do this. preGSf90 gave this message:

 Number of Genotyped Animals exceed capacity of the program
  
 Please contact I. Misztal -  ignacy@...

After some tests, I found the the maximum number of genotyped animals to be roughly 15000. Is this correct?Can this
number be increased? 

Thanks in advance,Richard
