Â Thank Andres very much.

 I also have another question.
 When I want to run a model which has both additive effect and maternal effect.
 How can I create a parameter file:
 should I put both of them together in the RANDOM_GROUP as

 RANDOM_GROUP
 2 3Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  # 2 and 3 are animal and dam id respectively
 RANDOM_TYPE
 add_animal
 FILE
 renadd02.ped
 (CO)VARIANCES
 Â Â  1.0000Â Â Â Â Â  0.10000Â Â Â  
 Â  0.10000Â Â Â Â Â Â  1.0000

 Yes

 OR can I put them separately as:

 RANDOM_GROUP
 2Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  #animal id
 RANDOM_TYPE
 add_animal
 FILE
 renadd02.ped
 (CO)VARIANCES
 1
 RANDOM_GROUP
 3Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  # dam id
 RANDOM_TYPE
 add_animal
 FILE
 renadd02.ped
 (CO)VARIANCES
 1



 In this case, you fit them as uncorrelated (no genetic covariance between animal and dam effect)

 SHOULD I use add_animal or add_an_upg in RANDOM_TYPE?



 Both work, depending if you want to use UPG's or not
 Andres

 Thanks.
