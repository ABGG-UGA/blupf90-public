Hello!
I'm trying to run an analysis with only the maternal permanent environment. I ran a complete model, that consider also
the maternal effect, and then removed this effect for MPE analysis. But it shows the message: * Warning * may need to
increase # samples     3     4
This is my renf90 parameter card. Am I removing correctly the maternal effect?
