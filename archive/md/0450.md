 Hellow sir.I'm work in  RURAL DEVELOPMENT ADMINISTRATION(south korea)
Nowdays, I Study on Genetic Parameters of Primal cuts and Carcass Traits in Korea Hanwoo cattle. at that time i used REMLF90 software. 

My question is...

How is different between phenotypic correlations coefficient(in REMLF90 using by G+E=P) and observed phenotypic correlation coefficient(in RENUMF90)?
 I will be waiting for your answer.
