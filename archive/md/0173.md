Dear all, 

I'm having some issues using THRGIBBS1F90 on Windows 64-bit. I am using a single trait model, for a categorical trait with 8 categories (from 1 to 9). I used AIRELF90 to get estimates of variances to include in the parameter file, and it worked fine. However, when I ran the same parameter file (with the cat OPTION), data and pedigree on THRGIBBS1F90 it read the files, asked me for the number of samples, length of the burn-in, and the thining interval, but after that it stopped with the following error message:

--------
 
 Give n to store every n-th sample? (1 means store all samples)
100

-----------
What does this means?

I checked the data and parameter files and seemed to be fine, and I used notepad++ to format everything. 

Regards
