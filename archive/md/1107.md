Check that the	“form” for your animal effect is ‘cross’,We found that using “numer” for the animal effect
in the current version could gave the error "ID from SNP file not found.”

and recently updated it. Prior to the update the my code and data produced a Manhattan plot showing SNP effect, but
after the update using the same files when I run renumf90 for the first parameter file I get an error "ID from SNP file
not found." Also the number of animals with records and the number of animals with genotypes are the same but the
number with records or genotypes and total number are doubled and the number with genotypes and no records is the same
as with records and with genotypes. So I think its reading the IDs in the SNP file as different from the IDs in the
pedigree but I'm not sure why it would do that. Should I be formatting any of my files differently now because of the
update?
