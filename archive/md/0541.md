 They are fine. Your model includes, say, 100 levels for litter. Of these, 90 litter are "in" the data. But when you multiply the prior distribution by the likelihood to get the posterior distribution there is no ambiguity - the posterior is chi-square (say) with 100 degrees of freedom.

 Another point of view is the likelihood. It is the same whether you have 90 or 100 levels:
 p(y | variance components) = N(Xb,V) where V=ZGZ' + R
 and the Z takes into account that you have 10 "empty" levels.

 This is true as far as there is a variance structure for everyone. If you only put covariance structure (e.g. an identity, in the case of "diagonal") for the 90 litters in data in forget about the remaining 10, then you are in trouble.

Â Hello allI just wondering whether would be wrong one gibbs sampling in which the number of levels in the parameter file is larger than actual number of levels of a given random factor.Â Why am I asking this: Imagine you want to analyze a subset of your sample, and when you take the subset a part of the litters are discarded. The format of the new subset data will be the same as the original but the number of levels of some factors might be different, can you still using the same parameter file as for the original data set? 

It is my understanding that yes. Solutions for "void" levels will oscillate around 0 (they are sampled from the prior), and this will not affect the posterior, although the mixing will be slow.

Or in the contrary you have to recode everything so that the levels go from 1 to n without missing levels, and providing in a new parameter file the correct number of actual levels.Â Thank youJuan PabloÂ Â Â Juan Pablo SÃ¡nchez SerranoGenÃ©tica y Mejora AnimalIRTATorre MarimÃ³n, 08140, Caldes de Montbui, BarcelonaTelf.: 934674040 Ext. 1561Fax : 938650954juanpablo.sanchez@...Â Â -- Andres Legarra+33 561285182INRA, UR1388 GenPhySE SAGACS 5262731326 Castanet Tolosan, France
