Hello everyone,
I encountered a problem while using BlupF90 with a SNP file.

It gives the following error :
Genotype file with wrong format !!!
First genotype SN pos is : 11 numbers of SNP : -1
SNP pos at genotype : 5 is : 11 numbers of SNP : 395751

What does it really mean ?

When I look at the file, it seems organized as it should (AnimalID/space/01200125....).
11 correspond to the numbers of digits at which the SNP data begins...

Have already seen this and if yes, how did you solve the problem ?

Thank you in advance,
Recoquillay Julien.
