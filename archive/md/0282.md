Hi All,

In analysis of calving ease and growth traits using sire maternal grand sire, some of genetic corraltions estimates
seem to be very high.
rg(CE,BW) =0.89
rg(WW,YW)=0.90
rg(PWG,YW)=0.86
I know those estimates were expected to be high, but they seem to be biased upward!
Note my data included only 2-year old dams(no full-sibs)
Are those estimates reasonable? if not , what could be the justification?


Thanks,


Hamad Saad
