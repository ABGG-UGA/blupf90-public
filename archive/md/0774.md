Stefano,
 As UPG are fixed effects, EBVs that include UPG are not estimable functions and absolute SE do not exist although the
program calculates some numbers. For SE calculations, remove UPG or make them random.

Â Dear All,
 I'm running some EBV estimation using blupf90 (3 traits repeatibility model, milk-fat-prot aprox 18k data & 26k
animals in the pedigree).
 I'm comparing results with and without parent groups. In both cases I'm usingÂ OPTION sol se. I have observed a 2-fold
increase in Standard error when I use parent groups.
I think I'm missing something,
Best
Stefano
