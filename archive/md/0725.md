Hi Yutaka,
Thank you for this anwer.

To answer your questions:
-My objective is to have a direct animal genetic effect + maternal [dam] permanent environmental effect.
-Indeed, as strange as it can seems, all traits are not affected by the dams.
-I am maybe a little too optimist but, yes I am going to.
-For this example, I had precoreccted my data for the fixed effect so only the random would have to be estimated by
remlf90 and thus hopefully gaining some computation time.

Again thank you for your answer,
Julien.
