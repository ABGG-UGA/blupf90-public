You don't need a parameter file for predf90. The program needs the SNP file for the animals you wanna predict DGV (it
will ask you the name of the file) and also a file called snp_pred created by postGSf90 (need to be in the folder you
are running).

find any description of how to run predf90.Could you tell me how to prepare a .par file for predf90 ?Additionally could
you compile a Windows version of predf90?
