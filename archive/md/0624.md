Dear all,
 I am a new user of BLUPf90.I run basic animal model with cage as random effect.I got three variance components with
their standard error : cage , genetic plus residual.However, I didn't get standard error for the phenotype variance.
Is the standard error for the phenotype variance is the sum of the standard error of 
cage , genetic plus residual ? If not how can I calculate it ?Thanks 
With best regards, jegna
