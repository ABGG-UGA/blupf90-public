Hello!
 
When I ran gibbs3f90 with random regression model, I encountered 2 problems:
1.	 How to specify the prior for random effect? Should it be ordered as traits within random regression
coefficients or random regression coefficients within traits? Is the layout of prior here the same as the output of
variance component estimated by airemlf90?
2.	 My data were production records from 3 parities of cows. I want to set residual variances heterogeneous.
However, I seems that the sampled residual variances had no relationship to the prior I specified.
For example, in parameter file I wrote:
    RANDOM_RESIDUAL VALUES
14.057	     0.46339   0.43541	 0	 0	 0	 0	 0	 0
0.46339     4.22E-02  1.58E-02	0	0	0	0	0	0
0.43541     1.58E-02  1.75E-02	0	0	0	0	0	0
0	 0	 0	 25.56	      0.8585	  0.79582   0	    0	    0
0	 0	 0	 0.8585      6.86E-02  2.99E-02  0	 0	 0
0	 0	 0	 0.79582   2.99E-02  3.06E-02  0       0       0
0	 0	 0	 0	 0	 0	 29.598      0.98735   0.92944
0	 0	 0	 0	 0	 0	 0.98735   7.40E-02  3.36E-02
0	 0	 0	 0	 0	 0	 0.92944   3.36E-02  3.53E-02
But the residual variance from the first round was:
      Residual variance, interval	     1
	      R
	     4799.9	  4784.1       4784.0	    0.0000	 0.0000       0.0000	   0.0000	0.0000

7726.0	 
       Why did this happen? Is it because I specified them in a wrong way, or something else? For your reference,
attachments are the parameter file for gibbs3f90 and part of the output on the screen.
 
Thank you so much!
 
Looking forward to your reply!
