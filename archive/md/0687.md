Dear Juliana and Tsuruta

Did the proposed syntax actually work out?
I used both -9 and 99 as alternatives but the renumf90 just kicks out any zero's (in this case for a covariable).
We also tried -9 and 99 as missing values for traits but records with these missing traits seem to be kept in the data.


What could we try to shed some light on this?


All the best


Steven
