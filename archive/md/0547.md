 I cannot remember if the tolerance is the same in the initial checking as in the regular running. But possibly you're
right and there are not decimals enough.
 What I do in this case is to load the estimates in R, decompose in eigenvalues/vectors (UDU'), increase the smaller
eigenvalue and then plug the "new" values into the parameter file.

Â I wanted to restart remlf90 by plugging in the last obtained estimates (after 24h of computing) as starting values
but apparently the covar-matrix for a random effect was not pos definite.So my question was if more decimals could
alleviate the problem and if one could print those estimates with more decimals?
 Thank you
