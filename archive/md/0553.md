 You can create a fake pedigree with unrelated animals up the number of animals n:

 1 0 0 
 2 0 0
 3 0 0 
 ...
 n 0 0

 This creates a relationship matrix A=identity matrix

 For inversion, preGSf90 will use 0.95G + 0.05 A, which in this case os 0.95G + 0.05 I . This makes matrix G invertble
and the difference is negligible.
 VERY important you need to deactivate all quality control related to pedigreeÂ  and also all corrections of G to
resemble A:
OPTION thrStopCorAG -1d0
 OPTION tunedG 0

 I am currently putting together a genomic evaluation in beef cattle. We have no observed pedigree, but we do parentage
analysis from SNP data to create one. Some animals (10%) do not get assigned parentage, but are still useful through
the genomic relationship matrix.Â 
Any thoughts on how this affects GBLUP? I do not think we are adding information to the analysis by putting in
parentage that is observed in the genomic relationship matrix. Would we be better off just putting in a dummy pedigree?
Something like
1 0 02 0 03 0 0
Thank you for your time.
