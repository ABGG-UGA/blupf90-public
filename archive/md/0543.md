Dear all,

After running THRGIBBS1F90 and POSTGIBBSF90
Is there any possible method or algorithm to test the convergence of the analysis?
Up until now, my only solution is looking at the graph. Is it any other ways for calculating values which may indicate
the convergence?
Thank you very much,
Tuan
