Dear allI obtained the POSTOUT file after running postgibbsf90.Here I obtain mean of the parameter with MCE, PSD and also 95%PD
I wonder, what statistics should be supplied with mean of the estimate now?
In AI/REML we provide SD or SE of the parameter. Here in this case what should be reported along with the mean of the parameter?
Thanks and regards,
