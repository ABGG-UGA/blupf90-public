Yes, the program sets 0 and 1 to the first 2 thresholds. To transfer solutions into the probability scale, you can use
pnorm in R or any to use CDF, adjusting the mean by thresholds and the other fixed effect (usually contemporary group)
or setting the specific mean (e.g., the value for 75% in probability).
