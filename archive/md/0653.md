Dear Dr. Legarra

I have few questions related to genomic selection using GS3 ( cross validation), I have run Snp_BLUP,  BayesC,	etc.
Using different  SNP densities for linear trait. For Binary trait, I have coded as 1 and 2,  and 0 as missing,	plus
the OPTION BinaryTrait at the end if the file 
1. Apparently, i have convergence problem with the Binary trait,  did not converge even at 150000 runs. What can be the
possible reason? The same date converge properly with airemlf90!  
2. Also, when we run BLUP in gs3 without SNP file ( only pedigree) with known variances, is this same as Normal BLUP?  


Thank you very much
