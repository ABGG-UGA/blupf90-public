```
I compare two methods BLUP and ssBLUP together. In ssBLUP method and in order to pre-select, place 0 in the data file
for candidates and give genomic information of them and their parent's phenotypes and genotypes to BLUPf90. The results
showed that average breeding values are very different and the mean of breeding values of ssBLUP are significantly
lower. Despite the fact that accuracy has increased and the phenotypic average is also desirable.
