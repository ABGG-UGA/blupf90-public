 Fernando,

 this will estimate covariances of the first tick with the rest, this is not optimal. 
 You need to put this way

 animal tick bw ww yw sc
 1 0 35 205 440 32.5
 1 38 0 0 0 0
 1 10 0 0 0 0
 1 12 0 0 0 0

 then fit permanent effect for ALL the traits. This will be confounded with the residual for bw, ww, yw, sc, so at the end you will have to sum residual + permanent variance of ww to obtain the actual residual variance for ww. Same for covariances .

 If you read French this old document may help you :-)

   Dear All,

 I want to fit a multitrait model for five traits, where just one has
 repeated measures. For each animal, I have from 1 to 3 tick count
 measures and then birth, weaning and yearling weight plus scrotal
 circunference (if male). My questions is regarding the data structure,
 because I should have multiple lines for tick counts on the same
 animal, but just one line for the other traits (since they have single
 measurements). I thought that I could have records listed for all
 traits in first line of the animal and list just repeated measures of
 tick counts in the subsequent lines, setting the other traits as
 missing.

 E.g. Animal 1 with three counts (tick=38, 10, 12), bw=35, ww=205,
 yw=440 and sc=32.5, I would have three date lines:

 animal tick bw ww yw sc
 1 38 35 205 440 32.5
 1 10 0 0 0 0
 1 12 0 0 0 0

 Is that OK? Is there other way to set the equations?

 I appreciate your thoughts,

 Best,

 Fernando
