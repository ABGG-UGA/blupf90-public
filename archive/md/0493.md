Dear all,
Considering a categorical trait with two categories (success or failure) in which success is calve three times up to
six years old, we have censored data (cows with less than six years).A cow of four years old and two calves have higher
probability of success than another with the same age and a single calf. Both data are censored, but with different
probabilities of success.
How to treat it using THRGIBBS1F90?

Regards,
Henrique
