 There is an "F" in your data file, and the read statements only read numbers. This may be the problem.

  Â Hi, Â Iâ€™m currently trying to run a BayesCPi model in GS3. Iâ€™ve used example files from the Feb 2013 course in Padova as a template for my own files, but I canâ€™t get them to run correctly. When I look at the log, the program does not seem to be recognising any records in the datafile (â€œdata file: testPheno_gs3.txtÂ Â Â Â  with:Â Â  0 recordsâ€), and I assume its as a result of this that the program stops at â€œtransforming yZW ->multiplyweighted = Tâ€ and never starts any iterations - it doesnâ€™t give me an error, it just never moves past this point. Can anyone advise me what it is that Iâ€™ve done wrong to stop this from working? Data files etc are attached. This is based on a small test data set so the number of iterations etc is much smaller than I would use for a proper run. Â Also, I tried to add an animal effect (1 add_animal 10), but whenever I try to include this in the parameter file I get a fortran error â€“ â€œAt line 272 of file ../src/gs3.f90 (unit = 7, file = â€˜Ó±ÆšÃ³â€™) Fortran runtime error: File â€˜â€™ does not existâ€. If anyone could tell me what causes this and what I can do to avoid it Iâ€™d also be really grateful. Â Best wishes,Alex
