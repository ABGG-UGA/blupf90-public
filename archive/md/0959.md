The result from sire model could be more stable when we don't have good pedigree information (i.e., many missing
parents) and/or have very few incidents per animal. On the other hand, animal model could be more accurate when we have
sufficient information.

Yes, you are right. When you run renumf90, you can assume animal model, but in your pedigree file, sire, sire's sire,
and sire's dam. The program will estimate sire variance, which is one quarter of direct additive variance.
