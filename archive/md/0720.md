Hi Recoquillay,

There is a way to prepare the files supporting your model. But your model is very complicated so you can split the
whole process into three small steps: 1) run renumf90 and prepare the files and 2) modify renf90.par to use your model
and 3) run blupf90/airemlf90/gibbs2f90 with the modified renf90.par. Please not to think to obtain the complete
renf90.par in one step by using renumf90. The file renf90.par is just a template so you should modify it to support
your model.

The parameter file you supplied has several issues. I have to make sure some aspects to tell the details. 

- Do you actually assume a regular maternal model (direct [animal] genetic effect + maternal [dam] genetic effect +
maternal [dam] permanent environmental effect) ?
- Some traits have maternal effects but some not. Is it correct?
- Are you assuming the genetic correlation between direct and maternal genetic effects?
- This is for a 7-trait model. Are you going to estimate variance components with all the 7 traits?
- Your example has no fixed effects. Is this what you really want to do? Or just an example?

Yutaka
