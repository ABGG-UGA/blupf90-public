Hi,
I was running thrgibbs1f90 on a multi-traits threshold model to obtain EBV. The output gave me EBV and their associated
SD. I am wondering how can I get Standard Error for these EBV so I can get the accuracy? I found that the ACCF90 can
provide approximate SE and ACC, but I do not know where I can download it or access it. I am using LINUX system
(ubuntu) to run these analysis. Is there anyway I can download a version of accf90 I can run in LINUX like
thrgibbs1f90?
Thank you very much.
