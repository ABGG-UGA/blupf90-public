The degree of belief are for each (co)variance matrix of the random effect and the residual. There is no option to
specify different degree of belief for each component of the covariace matrix 


in your case:
OPTION prior 1 4   10 4   11 4	 -1 4

Hi all. I really need help on specification of Degree of belif for multivariate model in gibbs3f90 
Here is what I see in the manual, but it only tell how to do with univariate. But since I deal with multivariate,
specifically, three-trait model
OPTION prior eff1 db1 eff2 db2 â€¦ effn dbn -1 dbres

For my case, I have 3 traits and have three random terms as the 1st, 10th, and 11th variables in the model. Suppose I
believe df=4 works for all random and residual terms.  I tried to different ways listed below:
OPTION prior 1 1 1 4 10 10 10 4 11 11 11 4 -1 -1 -1 4 ;OPTION prior 1 4 4 4 10 4 4 4 11 4 4 4 -1 4 4 4 ;OPTION prior 1
4 1 4 1 4 10 4 10 4 10 4 11 4 11 4 11 4 -1 4 -1 4 -1 4;
OPTION prior 1 4 10 4 11 4 -1 4 1 4 10 4 11 4 -1 4 1 4 10 4 11 4 -1 4;

Nevertheless, I always got an error message" It should be equal to (# random effect +1 ) * 2 =		  8 OPTION
prior rndeff1 db1    rndeff2 db2 ...	rndeffn dbn    -1 dbres" . So I think I might just need specify 2 degree of
belief for three-trait model. then I tried following 
OPTION prior 1 1 4 10 10 4 11 11 4 -1 -1 4 ;OPTION prior 1 4  4 10 4 4 11 4 4 -1 4 4 ;OPTION prior 1 4 1 4 10 4 10 4 11
4 11 4	-1 4 -1 4;
OPTION prior 1 4 10 4 11 4 -1 4 1 4 10 4 11 4 -1 4 ;
Still no luck.
IS there anyone willing to share the experience about it? I really appreciate any suggestion.

Thanks in advance!
