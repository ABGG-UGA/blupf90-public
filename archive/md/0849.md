Hi Group,I'm using in AI-REMLF90 ver. 1.128 on linux.here are options used in my renum.par fileOPTION EM-REML
5500OPTION use_yamsOPTION maxrounds 10000OPTION conv_crit 1d-10

I have found three options concerning a seting of number of threads.
OPTION num_threads_pregs <n>OPTION num_threads_iod <n>OPTION nthreads <n> unfortunately, none of these three options is
able to force airemlf90 to run defined number of threads.
Is it possible to set a number of threads.
Thank you,
```
