Hi,
I'm pretty new using blupf90 programs and I'm wondering how to adjust the covariate included in my model to a
polynomial function. I guess I have to follow the follow instructions from the manual, but I really don't know how to
prepare the indicated datafile.
 Random regression models may have many correlated random effects. Assume a data file with the following positions: 
1 to 4: polynomials --> Do I have to include in my parameter file both the intercept and slope from the polynomial 
function? 

5: animal number
6 herd year season 
…
EFFECTS: POSITIONS_IN_DATAFILE NUMBER_OF_LEVELS TYPE_OF_EFFECT [EFFECT NESTED]
6 50 cross # herd year season
1 1000 cov 5 # first polynomial nested within the animal effect position 5
2 1000 cov 5 # second polynomial nested within the animal effect position 5
3 1000 cov 5 # third polynomial nested within the animal effect position 5
4 1000 cov 5 # fourth polynomial nested within the animal effect position 5
….
RANDOM_GROUP
2 3 4 5 # all covariables are correlated (effects 2, 3, 4, and 5 on the list above)
RANDOM_TYPE
add_animal # additive genetic
FILE
file.ped # name of pedigree file
(CO)VARIANCES
(4 x 4 matrix)


Thanks in advance,


Carolina.
