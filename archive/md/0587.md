Hello,
I have been running a two-trait analysis with an indicator trait and a carcass trait which should be correlated. I have been using blupf90 with 8,000 genotyped individuals with a two-generation pedigree for about half of the population. In total there are around 16,000 animals in the analysis. 
The result of the two-trait analysis gives a breeding value estimate that appears inflated compared to the breeding value produced from running each trait separately in GBLUP. The inflation appears to be around a 5-fold increase. 
I have experimented with changing the alpha/beta and omega/tau values, but this does not appear to change the result much.
Is this inflation phenomenon a concern?
Thanks,
Justin
