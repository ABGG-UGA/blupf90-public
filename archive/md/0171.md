 Hi 


To setup fixed threshold you need  add several lines of OPTION thresholds ..... 


the first OPTION corresponds to the first categorical trait, and so on 


then for each categorical trait you need to specify the corresponding threshold. 


the other thing is that all traits should have fixed thresholdsOn 28/08/2013, at 15:20, Tiago Passafaro

Hi,


I´m sorry, my problem was a little different!
The model are the same, however i would like to use the option threshols.


When I use this option to set the thresholds for traits with 6 categories, like this example: 
OPTIONS thresholds 0.0 1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0, the program doesn´t work.


However when i use this option for traits with 4 categories, like this: OPTIONS thresholds 0.0 1.0 2.0, the program
works! 


So my question is: Can i set the threshold for traits with 6 categories? If i can´t, this have any impact to estimate
genetic parameters or predict breeding values?


Thanks!

 yes


assuming that the first 5 have 6 categories and the last 2 have 4:
OPTION cat 6 6 6 6 6 4 4

Dear all,


I´m fitting a multiple trait model with seven categorical traits.
I would like to analyze this model using the program Thrgibbs1f90.
In my data I have five traits with six categories and two traits with four categories.
I would like to set the theresholds for each traits. 


My problem is, traits with 6 categories i can set the theresholds, but traits with 4 categories i can´t.
So my question is: Can I set differents thereshold for each trait? and how can I do this?


Could you help me, please?


Thank you!
