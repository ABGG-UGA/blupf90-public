One way to do it is to add a random covariable nested with every observation. Let
 rt - covariable for trait t
 vt - variance for this effect for trait t
 et - residual variance for trait t as defined in parameter file.

 The total residual variance is:  et+ rt^2 x vt.  
 Assume rt goes from 0 to 1. Then et is the minimum variance and vt is set so that et+vt is the maximum variance.

   Hi, I’m trying to run a dataset through renumf90 with 3 yield traits for cattle so that I can run a multivariate
model in aireml and blupf90. I would like to weight by effective daughter contributions, and these are different for
each trait. I have specified the column number of each trait in the datafile, and also the column number of each
corresponding edc column (part of parameter file copied below) in the weight(s) section, but when I try to run renumf90
I get en error saying I can only use one number for weight. Is it possible to run a multivariate model with a different
weight for each trait? If so, could anyone tell me what I’m doing wrong, and if not, should I resort to running each
trait in a univariate model? Any help appreciated, Cheers,Alex First part of renumf90 parameter file…..
