```
First, use thrgibbs1f90 instead of thrgibbs1f90b (this is for binary traits).Second, 1000000 is too many. I recommend
100000, 0 (burn-in), 10 (saving every 10-th sample), first. If you need more, you can continue.
Third, your parameter file is not correct, messed up with parameter files from renf90.par and for renumf90. In "OPTION
cat 0 5", "5" should be the number of categories.
Fourth, run without "OPTION solution all" for variance component estimation unless you are interested in all samples of
all solutions for some reason.
Please read the blupf90 manual for details.
