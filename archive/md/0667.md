Dear Juan,

 I am not aware of any trick that you can use to fit a reduced animal
 model with blupf90 programs. Long time ago (during my PhD), I changed
 Gibbsf90 to fit a reduced animal model (the mendelian sampling
 variance is included in the residual for non-parents) and if there is
 no other easy way to do that and the problem is not too big, I can
 look back in that code and share it with you.

 Best,

 Fernando
