  Dear all,

I'm trying to fit a model that include maternal permanent environment (MPE) and common environmental (CE) effects to
estimate their value using BLUP method. For illustrative purposes, please assume a single dairy herd with the following
data structure for seven kind:
****** HOW IT LOOKS LIKE****Birth_weight	Sex	  Dam	   Sire     ID3.2		      1 	   2   
       1	  62.4			   2		2	    1	       72.5			2	     2 
	 3	    81.8		     2		  4	      3 	 92.9			  1	      
4	    3	       103.0			 1	      4 	  1	     112.1		       2       
    4		5	   12
So, i tried to make mixed model equations.You know that matrix W (matrix maternal permanent environmental) should be
have the following structure:			  2	    4			  1	   0			 1     
  0W=		     1	      0 		    0	     1			   0	    1			  0    
   1			 0	  1	     My question is how can i make common environmental effect matrix?
I can not understand what is different between MPE and CE matrices.What would be a good and clean way to understand
this?
Greatly appreciate any help.
