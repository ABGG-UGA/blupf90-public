 Facundo, this is intriguing. 
 Can you post the parameter files and a short portion of the data file ?

¬ Hi there,

 I am performing some tests and observing different likelihoods for two
 (as far as I understand) equivalent parameterizations of the model,
 using the same (simulated) dataset.

 Specifically, I am simulating a multivariate gaussian vector, with a
 given (3x3) covariance matrix Sigma.
 I distribute these values in three "sites", and my simulated dataset
 contains variables `site` and `genotype`.
 Furthermore, I simulate some residuals and add everything to a
 supposedly observed phenotype.

 For fitting my multi-site model, I take two alternative approaches, that
 I think are equivalent.

 Approach 1:
 - split the `genotype` variable into three different variables `g1`,
 `g2` and `g3` that are copies of `genotype` where I set to 0 the values
 at sites other than 1, 2 or 3 respectively.
 - make a random group with these 3 variables
 - fit the model

 Approach 2:
 - build an indicator matrix for `site` (n x 3)
 - make three effects as in: `col n.genotypes cov col.genotype`
 - make a random group with these 3 effects
 - fit the model

 Both approaches work well, in the sense that with enough data I recover
 the covariance matrix used for simulating the data, and the BLUPs are good.
 Moreover, both approaches yield **identical** variance components and
 solutions.

 However, the likelihood and AIC of approach 2 is much worse (e.g. AIC1 =
 4569; AIC2 = 4753).

 Why is this happening?

 Thanks
 ∆íacu.-
