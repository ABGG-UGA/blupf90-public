 Well, from those numbers you can compute the Bayes Factor or the DIC.

 and interpret your results. In principle lower result of -2log(p(y)) (which means higher p(y) ) is better, but how
much better?  A good lecture of Sorensen & Gianola book and their references may help you.

discover which is best? Thank you! Sheila.
