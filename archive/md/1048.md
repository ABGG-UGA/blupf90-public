Dear Legarra and the users 


There has been some recent update in blupf90 family programs (From Feb, 2019 and also in March, 2019). With these
modules I am unable to run : postGS90 option. Every time I receive the message :
" forrtl: severe (41): insufficient virtual memory "


and the program stops at : 


*------------------------*
* Setup Genomic Done !!! *
*------------------------*


Solutions read from file: "solutions"




I am pretty sure, this is not the problem with memory as I have tried with 16G to 48G memory in the server. Exactly
same options and the model ran with previous postGSf90 without any error. 


If anyone faced such problems ?


Thanks,
Rama Bangera
