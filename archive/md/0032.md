 It is necessary because otherwise residual variance and thresholds are not identifiable at the same time. For a
detailed explanation, read the Sorensen & Gianola book or Sorensen (1996, GSE)

 2 traits -> You *need* a prior of 1
 6 traits -> you vcan fix two thresholds and not use a prior for Residual Variance. But I don't think this is possible
for blupf90 programs. So instead, you should use a prior for residual variance.

 thats recommended that the prior for Residual Variance in categorical traits
 must be 1.
 is there any relationship between category # and prior of Residual Variance?
 for example trait with 2 categories in comparison to trait with 6 categories.
 thanks.
