This is in a research phase at this time.
The variance explained is calculated using the GEBV for each windows of n adjacent SNP as the proportion of the total

 I work with your software blupf90. I have a question.

 Is the variance explained by markers in chrsnpvar file scaled or standardized. In the manual, it did not explain how
the variance is obtained. It dose not seem that it is simply 2pqa2 ??
 Thanks in advance
 Warm Regards,
