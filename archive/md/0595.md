Using a missing value for an effect is equivalent to having such an effect = 0. Uf this is what you want, it is OK.

 If the system of equations is not full rank, having 0 may lead to weird results. Lets say that you have a sex effect
with solutions 2.5 and 3.5. With aÂ  different solver, the sex effect may be 10.1 and 11.1 (same difference). So having
0 for missing value will cause different impacts dependent on the generalized solution.

 Say, for example, that I have lost the sex code of someone (or the value is obviously mistaken).
 Can I still use the subject in my data or should I remove it?

 From my tests, if the variable is a regressor, a value of 0 is interpreted as a value rather than a code for missing
value.
 On the other hand, if the variable is categorical (i.e. cross-classified), then the programs run, but the results are
quite erratic.
