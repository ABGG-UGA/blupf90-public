Hello everyone,
Iâ€™m trying to estimate (co)variance components in two-trait analysis using SNP information and fake pedigree.
However, the preGSf90 program always stop with the message below:
Random Effect(s)   18 Type of Random Effect:	  additive animal Pedigree File:	      renadd18.ped	       
														       
													 G Matrix not
symmetric  Can you please explain why the G matrix is no symmetric?How can I solve this problem?
Kind regards,Tiago 
```
