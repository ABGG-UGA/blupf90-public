The snippet:
open(1,file='GimA22i',format='unformatted')
doÂ 
Â  read(1,iostat=io) i,j,A(i,j) [not sure this is the exact format] Â <- the format is correct
Â  if(io/=0) exit
enddo

Â I would like to read the binary files produced by preGSf90 with a non-Fortran language. Could you please provide a
bit more information about the format of those files, or alternatively a snippet of the Fortran code that writes or
reads the files?

 open(1,file='GimA22i',format='unformatted')
