You will find a simple	example at http://nce.ads.uga.edu/html/projects/programs/examples/thr1/ for a threshold-linear
model. The cblupf90 program works only with one categorical and one linear traits. If you work on more traits with a
larger model, I suggest to use thrgibbs1f90. This is more stable and easier to handle.
