Hi All,

In analysis of calving ease(CE), birth weight(BW), weaning weight(WW), post weaning gain(PWG), and yearling weight
(YW), some estimates of genetic correlations that I got using sire maternal grandsire were very high
 G-corr (CE,BW) = 0.89(0.01)
G-corr (WW,YW) = 0.9 (0.01)
G-corr (PWG,YW) =0.86(0.02)
I know those traits were expected to be highly correlated, but those estimates seem to be biased upward!
Note I included only 2-year old dams in my data, so there is no full-sibs animals. 
Are those estimates reasonable? if not what could be the justification ?


Thanks,


Hamad Saad
