I think it is possible, but I don't know if I'm right. 
Imagine a scenario where there are several full sibs and half sibs in an endogamic strain forming diagonal elements of
high values in the traditional A matrix. Maybe in G matrix the actual values would not be so high, consequently the
correlations of diagonal elements would expect to not be high as well. Now for the off-diagonals elements the more
related animals in A matrix (families) would still be the more related animals in G, even the actual value is not the
same, because families were formed. Just thinking in some possible scenario where this could happen. Maybe other people
could help us better. Cheers,

 Hi there,running BLUPF90, I noticed a very low correlation (close to zero) between G and A22 diagonal terms. However,
correlations between all terms and off-diagonal terms were 0.77 and 0.73, respectively. 
Is it possible to have a so low correlation for the diagonal terms, if other correlations are moderate to high?
