Hi,

I am new to "THRGIBBS1F90". I started  the examples in the webpage
("http://nce.ads.uga.edu/html/projects/programs/examples/thr1/") using exgen and data.thr, I thought I may get the
"gibbs_sample" file that I can use for the POSTGIBBSF90. But I received the following files in binary format. 

Highly appreciate your comments to proceed this.

Thanks

Shani
