If (AI)REMLF90 converges well without genomics but converges slowly or 
 diverges with single-step, do the following:
 1. Limit pedigrees and phenotypes to few generations; including more 
 than 3-4 does not increase accuracy.
 2. Eliminate genotypes of young animals.

 The problem is caused by artificial differences between A22 and G and 
 shows up mainly with simulated data sets. Defaults in blupf90 include 
 inbreeding in inv(A22) but exclude it in inv(A). This increases the 
 differences when the number of generations in pedigrees is long. Another 
 satisfactory solution, aside from steps above, is including inbreeding 
 in inv(A). A metafounder concept - now under testing - may ultimately 
 solve the issue of differences between G and A22 for any data set.
