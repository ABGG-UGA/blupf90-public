Thanks for your answer. I prefer to use this option because all my parameter files are already written with it.
 I tried to download the new version on http://nce.ads.uga.edu/html/projects/programs/Linux/64bit/ but it is still the 1.114 version. Where can I find the 1.116 ?

 Thanks in advance, 
 Regards,
 Julie

  Â Thanks for reporting the issue, we can replicate the problem.Â Version 1.116 have a correction for this bug.Â 
In the meantime you can create a new variable in awk for example .Â

Dear,

 
I have an error with the latest version of renumf90 (1.114) that I don't have with version 1.111 :

 
$ renumf90Â 
Â RENUMF90 version 1.114
Â name of parameter file?renum_aireml.par
Â renum_aireml.par
Â n_comb Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  1
Â ERROR in a "COMBINE" block



I have these two lines on the top of the parameter file :Â 
COMBINE 15 8 12
COMBINE 16 11 12


The problem seems to come from these lines but I don't understand because it works with the previous version.


Thanks in advance
Regards,
Julie
