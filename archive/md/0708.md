To make sure the data file is correct, please run single-trait analyses for each trait without heterogeneous residual
variance. If the results are not reasonable, there are some problems in the data file (or parameter file); possibly
wrong positions of columns are specified. If the results are acceptable, I need more information to guess the reason of
this issue. Please send the log (output on screen) from the beginning to the first few rounds.
