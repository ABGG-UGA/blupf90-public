Â I would like to read the binary files produced by preGSf90 with a non-Fortran language. Could you please provide a
bit more information about the format of those files, or alternatively a snippet of the Fortran code that writes or
reads the files? 

 The snippet:
 open(1,file='GimA22i',format='unformatted')
 do 
 Â  read(1,iostat=io) i,j,A(i,j) [not sure this is the exact format]
 Â  if(io/=0) exit
 enddo
 Andres


 Thanks
 Gerald Jansen
