Dear developers:


Â Â Â  the latest version of blupf90 and related programs - released May 19, 2018 - crash on my system (SUSE Linux
Enterprise 11 SP3, kernel 3.0.101) with the message:


blupf90: /lib64/libc.so.6: version `GLIBC_2.14' not found (required by blupf90)


Â Â Â  Unfortunatelly, I am unable to upgrade the system. Is it possible to have blupf90 compiled for such ancient
operating system? Versions released on March 10, 2017 and August 19, 2016 work without problems.


Â Â Â  thanks, and best regards, Horacio
