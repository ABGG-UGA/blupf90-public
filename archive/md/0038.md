  You need to create missing records (0) for trait 1 when trait2 is recorded and the opposite. Also you can create
extra "artificial" environments for missing traits. For instance, assume two sires, two env1 and three env2:


sire environment1 environment2 trait1 trait2
 1  1  4 25  0
 1  2  4 37  0
 2  1  4 22  0
 1  3  1 0   0.8
 2  3  1 0   1.2
 1  3  2 0   0.9
 2  3  2 0   2.1 
 
 The mixed model equations are created correctly. Each sire has its record. Also you need to fix the residual
covariance to 0 across traits.

 enjoy !

 Dear all. This is my first post. Am excited to join this network. 
 My problem is a bit basic. I would like to run a bivariate sire model for milk yield between a nucleus and the
commercial population. The examples i see on BLUPF90 have a somewhat different data structure. i.e. the traits are
measured at the same time. in my case they are measured in different herds and years. Any one with an idea how I can
handle this?
 The available examples look like: sire fixed effect trait 1 trait2

 my data is: sire1 environment 1 trait1 
 sire1 environment 2 trait 2 
 please help
