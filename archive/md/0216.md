Dear all,

I am trying to fit a random regression model with two traits (weigth and tick cattle). My random effects are additive
direct and permanent environmental for both traits and for weight, I have more random effects: the maternal and
maternal permanent environmental. 


For weigth, in a previous analysis a fourth order (Legendre) was indicated dor additive effect and for tick cattle the
linear (Legendre) was suggested. I would like to obtain the covariances between these traits.


I tried it:
Position data file, Number of levels, type, nested
11 0 15927 cov 7 0
12 0 15927 cov 7 0
13 0 15927 cov 7 0
14 0 15927 cov 7 0
15 0 15927 cov 7 0
0 11 15927 cov 0 7
0 12 15927 cov 0 7


however it did not work (error reading variances for effect 5)


Could you help me to fit this model to obtain the covariance between these traits?


With regards,
Tiago Passafaro
