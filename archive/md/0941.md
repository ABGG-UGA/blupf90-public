Dear All,
I want to make sure that I understand the results from "final_solutions" file correctly.
In the parameter file, I used "OPTION solution mean"
first, I ran THRGIBBS1F90 for 1,000,000 iterations and zero (0) for burn-in.
Then, I used postgibbsf90.exe for samples' analysis and chose the burn-in as 500,000.My questions are:
1/ For the Posterior means and SD for effects, are they from all 1,000,000 iterations or the last 500,000 after
burn-in?2/ For Animal effect, Level 1, is it the same animal with id 1 in the data file or it was just the "first"
animal used in the analysis?
Thank you very much for you attention and help.
Best regards,Tuan Nguyen
