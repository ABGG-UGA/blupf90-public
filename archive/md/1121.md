Dear blupf90 group:	I have some questions about setting parameter files in ssGWAS.
    1) If I use "blupf90" to get solution of GEBV directly, does it mean that the variance I set in file "renf90.par"
is the prior to solve mixed model?
   2) Should I	do "airemlf90" firstly to estimate genetic variance, and reset the variance in the file "renf90.par"?
   3) I tried to change the variance in the file "renf90.par",GWAS results will be changed.

   I am looking forward to get your reply.
    Thank you!
