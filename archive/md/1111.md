I am analysing a trait considering five cetegories (0 to 4) using THRGIBBS1F90. When the program is running it shows
the message Warning  !!!  lower bound  >  upper bound ...Does it mean there is any error in the analysis?I considered 
a chain of 1,000,000 samples, with burn-in 200,000 and thinning interval of 100.I used the following additional options
which are specific for categorical traits and for a trait with value 0:
OPTION cat 5OPTION missing -1
There is a picture of the Command prompt in attachment.
