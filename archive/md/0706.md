Hello,

I mean residual  variances. It looks like this when I use homogeneous residual variance.

#observations/interval:346023
 R
   0.0000	0.0000	  
   0.0000	0.0000

when changed to heterogeneous residual variance for the traits with repeated measurements, the residual part output is:

 Residual variance, interval		1

   0.0000	0.0000
