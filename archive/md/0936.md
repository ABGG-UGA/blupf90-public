You cannot specify the prior for direct-maternal covariance. You need to assume the same degrees of belief for the
covariance and variances.

Another point in your parameter file, I don't recommend to use "OPTION solution mean" when we don't know how many
samples should be discarded as burn-in to get convergence.
