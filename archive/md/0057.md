 Hi,

 integer*1 is definitely not portable. May be 1,2...whatever bytes depending on the compiler.

 You can use 
 integer,parameter:: int1=selected_int_kind(1) (zero? or two, or whatever)
 integer(int1) :: a 

 bit_size(i) will tell you the "size" of a.

 but my feeling is that the compiler will use at least 1 byte space for each integer of kind (int1).

 You can try using logical(0), which is mentioned on the Metcalf et al. book (Modern Fortran explained, 6.17) as being
1 bit in some compilers.

 If this is to treat SNPs, I've never encountered any memory problem so far treating them as integers...

 Hello all!!!

 Does anybody know whether it is possible to declare in fortran a variable as an integer of precision 1 bit?. 

 I want to save in this variable either 0 or 1. 

 Have been checking in google and we can define INTEGER *1 which means 1 byte (8 bits), but did not see anything
regarding 1 bit variables.

 Thank you for your comments
 Juan Pablo
