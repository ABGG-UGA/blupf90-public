Hello,
I am working with THRGIBBS1F90 and I wanted to know if you could share what the assumed prior distributions are for a
bivariate linear-threshold model. This paper:
Varona, L., I. Misztal, and J. K. Bertrand. 1999. Threshold-linear versus linear-linear analysis of birth weight and
calving ease using an animal model: I. Variance component estimation.. Journal of animal science 77:1994-2002.
doi:/1999.7781994x

describes the model, but it is not entirely clear what the assumed prior distributions are for linear-threshold and if
those assumptions are embedded in the current software.
Thanks,
Justin
