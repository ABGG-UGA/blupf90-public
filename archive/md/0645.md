```
This looks like the syntax that renumf90.exe generates after I feed it my original parameter file.  I tried altering the renf90.par file that renumf90.exe generates to match the syntex you suggested above, but it doesn't work. Can you suggest changes to my original parameter file that I feed into renumf90.exe? I have attached my documents above.Lyle
