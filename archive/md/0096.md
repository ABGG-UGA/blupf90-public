 Just put 10 cov 
 (don't put numer). numer/alpha is for cross-classified.

 Thank you so much for your concern,
 Now when I make the effect no. 10 (which I need it as covarable with the trait in study) as:
 EFFECT
 10 cov numer 
 I get this:
 too few or too many items for effect 9 . Was 3
 and should be 2 
 but when I make it:
 10 cross numer is works, so how can I make it as covariance, this no. 10 is arrival body weight and I need to
covariate it with weaning average daily gain.
