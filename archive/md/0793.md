Hello everyone. I want to estimate (co)variance component (especially non-additive effects: dominant and epistasis) of
growth traits in  goats with blupf90. When I add covam to models, logl and AIC were reduced extremely.(log1= from 8200
to 3600)Also, when I add dominant and epistasis to models, SE were increased extremely(from 0.001 to 36)
I have this problem with all traits. 
I will thank you to guide  me how to solve this problem.
