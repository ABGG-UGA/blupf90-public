 binary traits do not work in option BLUP.

 Dear Dr. Legarra

I have few questions related to genomic selection using GS3 ( cross validation), I have run Snp_BLUP, Â BayesC, Â etc.
Using different Â SNP densities for linear trait. For Binary trait, I have coded as 1 and 2, Â and 0 as missing, Â plus
the OPTION BinaryTrait at the end if the fileÂ 
1. Apparently, i have convergence problem with the Binary trait, Â did not converge even at 150000 runs. What can be
the possible reason? The same date converge properly with airemlf90! Â 
2. Also, when we run BLUP in gs3 without SNP file ( only pedigree) with known variances, is this same as Normal BLUP?Â 



 Yes, it is
 Andres


Thank you very much
