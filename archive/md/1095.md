Hi all
Recently (today) join the group as I am investigating variance component estimation using MCMC. I am using BLUPF90 GIBB
package to do so.
Now I am a beginner in MCMC and have read quite a bit on the topic and here’s what I got: MCMC will (eventually) give
you a posterior distribution after some random walk through parameter space. I got the impression that one should use
the MH algorithm to test the new parameter at each iteration and decide if yes or no it will be used. MH algo seem to
makes the random walk ‘less random’ and more conditional to the posterior distribution.
I could not see in the BLUPF90 doc but is the GIBB package uses MH? Or is there is an option I have not seen.Thanks all
