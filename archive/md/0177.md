Hello everybody,

I'm a post-doc at the Department of Animal Science at North Carolina State University. I work with Dr. Maltecca.
We encountered some problems when replicating iterative weighting procedures as reported in Wang et al. 2012 (Genome-wide association mapping including phenotypes from relatives without genotypes). 
To have a clearer insight of the problem, we simulated some data with QMsim. We tried both scenarios as reported in the paper above, either recalculating EBVs or keeping them fixed. We used blupF90 or preGSf90 to compute G and EBVs (for Scenario 2) and finally used postGSf90 to get marker effects and weights. Except for the first iteration, that didn't involve any weights in building G, all successive iterations (up to 15) used weights appositively calculated by postGSf90. 
Surprisingly happened that when using postGSf90 for both scenarios 1 and 2 we encountered a weird pattern of marker effects estimates. Actually, estimates from subsequent iterations were totally discordant (r~0), while estimates between odd or even iterations were concordant, and seemed to converge (r>0.9). In practical words, iterations 1, 3, 5, 7, ... headed to some values, while iterations 2, 4, 6, 8, etc headed to some other values.
I believe the problem is not in the method itself, as I wrote a simple R code for scenario 1 and it appears to work. I believe the problem is in how I used F90 programs, although honestly I can't find the bug.
If anyone in the group has experienced anything similar I'd ask to let me know. I probably mistook something in the commands to pass to the program.
For those interested please find attachment. There're parameter files as well as brief overlook of results.

I want to thank everybody in advance for any kind help.

Regards

Francesco
