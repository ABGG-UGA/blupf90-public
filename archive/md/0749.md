Andreas,

The effect part is correct. Put zero for the variance component that corresponds to the maternal effect you want to remove.

Â Dear blupf90 user & maintainer,

 I have a direct-maternal model running smoothly. I would like to remove 
 the maternal effect for one of the traits. Thus, I changed

 EFFECTS: POSITIONS_IN_DATAFILE NUMBER_OF_LEVELS TYPE_OF_EFFECT [EFFECT 
 NESTED]
 1 1 358138 cross
 2 2 358138 cross
 3 3 19562 cross
 RANDOM_GROUP
 1 2

 to

 EFFECTS: POSITIONS_IN_DATAFILE NUMBER_OF_LEVELS TYPE_OF_EFFECT [EFFECT 
 NESTED]
 1 1 358138 cross
 2 0 358138 cross
 3 3 19562 cross
 RANDOM_GROUP
 1 2

 Is this correct?

 I would expect that the respective line/column in the genetic variances 
 matrix (at "(CO)VARIANCES") would also have to be removed, but this is 
 not the case. If I do that (supply a 3x3 matrix), I run into the error
 "error reading variances for effect 1"

 If I supply the original genetic variances matrix (4x4) the calculation 
 runs, but does it do correctly? It puzzles me that variance values are 
 requested for something that is not part of the model.

 Kind regards
 Andreas Hoppe

 PS: Hope it is okay not to supply the full example as it is a general 
 syntax question.
