Mohamed,
It looks to me that you have a problem with the data file rather than with the pedigree one. Renum cannot find animals
with records while it sees the pedigree. Follow the remarks of Andres but in the data.

OPTION alpha_size?

 Thank you so much for your reply, I have created a .prn file, .txt and .file for the pedigree and all of them have the
same answer
 My pedigree file contains:
 1- Animal ID starting with 1 sequence.
 2- Sire ID
 3- Dam ID
 4- Year of birth, I wrote the whole year without recoding it.
