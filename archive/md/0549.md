Dear Prof,

This is Cheng Tan from University of Minnesota. I'm working on pig genomic selection.


I want to compare the accuracy between pedigree-BLUP and ssGBLUP, but I'm not sure how to calculate it. There is not a formula in the manual,and just say that EBV accuracy can be calculated based on se for EBV. I found a formula 1-se*se/Va somewhere, and I want to confirm it with you.


What's more, many public papers show kinds of formula for accuracy, for example, cor(g,y), cor(g,y-xb), cor(g,y-xb)/h, or others...... What do you think of them. And which one would you recommend?


Finally, I can not find ACCF90, could anyone send me the program? tanxx590@...


Looking forward  to your reply.Thanks.


Best wishes,


Cheng
