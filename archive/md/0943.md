Dear Shogo,

Thank you very much for your reply.


Could you please explain a bit more about "OPTION fixed_var"?


I understand the OPTION as when I had variance components, I would use the variance components to update the parameter
file, adding "OPTION fixed_var all". Then, run the thrgibbs1f90 program again. 


With the new parameter file, I think burn-in is not important. Am I correct ?


And how many iterations should I take now to get posterior means and SDs for solutions?


Best regards,
Tuan
