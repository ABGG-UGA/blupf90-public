John
current version is 1.35. 
I run your example and did not get this problem (I tested only in os x) see below for ped  is the original and ped2 is
with the added animal.

Hi, all-


I'm getting a "hash table search too slow" message from INBUPGF90 v. 1.31 on CentOS 7. Do any of you have any idea what
that might mean?


This pedigree completes with no problems (blank lines for ease of reading, there are no blank lines in the file):

8 0 0
4 0 0
10 0 0
6 0 0
2 0 0
15 11 1

14 0 0
11 0 0
16 11 2
12 0 0
18 11 4
13 0 0
20 14 6
17 11 3
19 11 5
24 14 10
22 14 8
11__3 11 3
11__21 11 21
11__5 11 5
11__7 11 7
11__23 11 23


However, if I add an animal, say, "11__15 11 15", I get the "hash table search too slow" message and no results. I see
the same problem with INBUPGF90 v. 1.27 on Mac OS as well.


My command line options and results are (on a Mac):

$ inbupgf90 --pedfile test.ped --method 1

 hash table search too slow


I've inspected the pedigree by hand, and even drawn it, and I don't see anything like multiple sexes assigned to the
same animal, or an animal appearing as its own parent. I've also replaced the underscores with letters, with no effect
on the results.


Any suggestions are appreciated.



Thanks,


John
