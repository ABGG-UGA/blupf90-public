## 1: First message -- high memory requirements with hash matrix

Ignacio Aguilar troubleshooted a problem with blupf90 where the memory 
 requirements were excessive. He found that the memory for the hash 
 matrix doubled when the matrix was less than 1% full. He found that for 
 many indices, iaddr as below was computed -2**31. After changing the 
 declaration of iaddr to integer (8), the problem was fixed.

 Hard to say whether it was a new compiler or not, but it seems that 
 overflows resulted in -2**31 rather than truncation.

 We put all our corrections on dodo7 under CVS. I will periodically 
 update the repository on the web site.
