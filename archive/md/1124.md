Dear
Is there a way to implement the metafounders approach in ssGblup in remlf90?
In the book of abstracts of the EAAP 2019 conference in Ghent (Genomic prediction with missing pedigrees in single-step
GBLUP for production traits in US Holstein) I found the following line:
"The alternative H-1 showed that the computation of A22-1 with MF is simplified with sparse-matrix techniques. The
newly-derived H-1 was implemented in the BLUPF90 programs."

However, in the revised manual (september 2019) of the BLUPf90 software, I don't seem to find any metafounder
implementation.
Kind regards
```
