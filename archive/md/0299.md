 Dear all,

 I'm a bit confused about the parameterization of the fixed part of the models.
 Let's say I have a couple of covariates: sex + generation.
 By running either remlf90 or airemlf90 I get the corresponding estimates of these fixed effects together with their
s.e.

 However, I would like to have an estimate of the overall mean, and its s.e.
 I need an intercept. I tried to introduce it manually, using a column of ones I get it estimated as zero with s.e. =
0.

 Is it possible to use alternative parameterizations like this one?

 Thank you.
