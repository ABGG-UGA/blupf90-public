Hi,
 This is my first post to this group (exciting!). I'm a recent convert to BLUPF90 and all the other F90 programs...but
the lack of info is unnerving.
 I'm analysing sensorial data. Got batch, session, panellist, sample and animal_id recorded. I know how to obtain the
panellist variance but suspect that it may differ across panellists. There are 9 panellists in total. How I can obtain
9 distinct variances?

 Thanks a lot

 data looks like
 id mean panellist batch session sample score
 1471 1 1 3 6 1 .00
 1527 1 2 3 3 2 .00
 1527 1 3 3 3 2 .00
 1470 1 3 3 7 3 .00
 1266 1 3 1 9 4 1.00
 1427 1 3 2 12 5 1.00
```
