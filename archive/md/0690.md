Dear Dr. Legarra


I have run MCMCBLUP with binary trait (probit model) for BLUP and GBLUP, here I presume (as its mentioned in the
manual), random effects are estimated via gibbs sampler and 

1. When I include only pedigree (without SNP data) its equal to SIMPLE Blup  = threshold model in other softwares
(similar to thegibbs1f90 in blupf90 programs) ?
2. When I include both Pedigree and SNP data its equal to GBLUP (or rather BLUP_SNP) ?


Also, when you include Pedigree, in GS3 we get polygenic breeding value and it considers relationship between the
animals  (A-Matrix) ?



Please let me know, if I am correct, especially with normal BLUP?


Thanks
