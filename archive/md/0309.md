```
Is it really a categorical trait?If it is categorical, you needÂ 
OPTION cat xx
where xx is the number of categories.
If it is not categorical, and If you get zero (residual) variance, it means that there is no variance or the scale is
too large (e.g., > 10000). You need to use a smaller scale for observations by /10, /100, or /1000.
