These questions are in common for thrgibbs1f90 and other gibbsxf90 programs:

 -In normal times, thrgibbs gives the solution in the binary_solutions 
 file that is -at least for me- unreadable.
 When estimating variances, we don't need every solution, but we may need 
 to use the last solution with "OPTION cont xxxx" for restarting the 
 program from the last sample. The last solutions are saved in binary 
 (non text) format. This file is used only for this option.

 -Using the OPTION solution allows to have the solutions to be written in 
 more friendly format.
 This option is for users who want to keep all or mean of solutions from 
 every Gibbs sampling. The program is sampling (estimating) variances and 
 solutions and saving them every time. But usually, this option is not 
 practical because it will use a large space in HD or the mean of 
 solutions is useless unless you already know the burn-in.

 -Using the OPTION fixed var is for using the threshold model without 
 re-estimating the variance of the traits with the help of the gibbs sampler.
 This option is to sample (estimate) only solutions using fixed (known) 
 variances and to save posterior means and SD of solutions. Usually, many 
 rounds are not necessary (5000 - 10000 samples are enough).
