```
I am running a ssBLUP analysis using the BLUPF90 and postGSF90.I have around 9,000 genotyped animals (750,000 SNPs per
each), 10,000 phenotyped animals and around 30,000 animals in the pedigree.When I used up to 30,000 SNPs, both the
BLUPF90 and postGSF90 worked, when I used up to 50,000 SNPs, the BLUPF90 worked, but the postGSF90 did not worked and I
got Bus error. When I used more than 50,000 SNPs, neither the BLUPF90 nor the postGSF90 worked and I got bus error
again. I am wondering if anyone has come across this error before or can provide some insight.Thank you very much
