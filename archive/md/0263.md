All:I am running a multiple trait with heterogeneous variance random regression model that involves a repeated trait
(Trait 1) and a trait with a single observation (Trait 2).  A toy example is below:AnimalResidual Variance
GroupTrait1Trait211On-Test Weight012Mid-Test Weight013Off-Test Weight0140Total Feed Intake21On-Test Weight022Mid-Test
Weight023Off-Test Weight0240Total Feed IntakeI have been able to run the model via Gibbs3f90 correctly through the
guidance of previous questions (.par file is attached), but I have been unsuccessful in getting the appropriate
residual (co)variance structure. I was wondering if there is a way to fix certain residual (co)variances to zero?Thanks
Jeremy Howard.
