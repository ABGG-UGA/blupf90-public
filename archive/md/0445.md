Hello everybody;
Regarding the prediction error variance (PEV) of EBVs needed to calculate the accuracy of genetic evaluations, why when
I use the (OPTION sol se) running the blupf90 program, the column of s.e. of solutions (solutions.txt) have only 1s,
however, when I try to use the same option running remlf90 it seems to wok well. Thanks in advance..
Orlando
