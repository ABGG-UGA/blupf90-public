```
!Read Â 50000 samples from round 10 to 500000
!Burn-in?
!250000 Â  Â # I chose to burn-in 250000
!Give n to read every n-th sample?
!50 Â  Â # I wanted to read every 50 samples
!Every n-th stored in gibbs_samples Â  Â  Â  Â	Â  Â  Â 10
!# samples after burn-in = Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  25000
!# samples after burn-in used = Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  5000


This number is calculated by


(500000 - 250000) / 50 = 5000


So, the number of samples used is 5000. This is correct.


!And the interval of the used samples is still 50,000 to 300,000.



Where are these numbers 50000 and 300000 coming from ?
