Dr. Muir,
I had the same problem during my Master's analysis... In my case I had some animals with all records missing for all
the traits.If it is the same situation, those animals should not be in your datafile. 
In my case it just crashed in the Gibbs Sampler...


Sincerely

parameter files etc with GIBBS restuls in an error, although differen for each GIBBS program For GIBBS2 I get forrtl

 All traits are missing; eliminate such records!
Any ideas?  I assumed that if it works with REMLF90 and AIREMLF90 that the data and parameter files are OK Bill
