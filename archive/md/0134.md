They do if one adds appropriate options (add_an_upginbr)  for the animal relationships and adds inbreeding information
to the relationship file. The inbreeding can be calculated using INBUGF90 by Ignacio Aguilar.

 Normally, the inbreeding information is ignored in constructing inv(A). Including the inbreeding information causes
EBV of inbred animals to increase, which is contrary to breeding interests.

matrix. Thank you for answer this simple question.
