Dear Shogo,I'm using the LINUX/64bit/renumf90 on an UBUNTU machine (Ubuntu 16.04.5 LTS - Release 16.04).


Unfortunately I have some problems because it stops when "hashing tables for effects set up"Interestingly I have no
problem if I use the Windows version (same data & ped).


I have already used the 64bit_old version but I got the same problem. I did some updates last week and I guess that it
might have caused the problem.


Any ideas/suggestion?


Regards
Stefano
