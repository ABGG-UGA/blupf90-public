Dear AndresThanks for the reply. Actually, i have tried with missing as default zero with other disease trait (number of days to death). Then, all yhay_residual file had y, yhat, yhat_se, as 0.000 0.000, 0.000 for all animals.


i am trying to figure out since few weeks, but no luck. Please let me know if you know something on this.


many thanks

  I have myself no experience in predictf90. Check output of predictf90 on screen and verify that -999 is considered as missing. May be that predictf90 does not support -999 as missing. I would anyway try coding 0 as missing and then 1/2 as healthy/sick.

 Dear 
I am trying to run single step ssblup for a disease trait in fish 



Data : with 2750 animals (trait = binary 0/1) genotyped for ~ 50000 SNP, the trait analyzed as linear
datafiles: phenotypefile, genotypefille, mapfile and pedigreefile 



the sequence of run is as follows :
1. renumf90 

- here i divided the data (renf90.dat) such that - testdata.dat (have random 20% missing genotypes  coded as -999), and validationdata.dat (with all those 20% missing data from testdata.dat). 

- the testdata.dat used in pregsf90, airemlf90 and postgsf90. validationdata.dat used in predictf90 . The .par file modified for each run. 

2. pregsf90 

important options used :
OPTION SNP_file genotypefile.txt
 OPTION chrinfo mapfile.txt


3. airemlf90 



important options used :
OPTION SNP_file genotypefile.txt
 OPTION conv_crit 1d-16
 OPTION chrinfo mapfile.txt
 OPTION missing -999



4. postgsf90


important options used:
OPTION SNP_file genotypefile.txt
 OPTION chrinfo mapfile.txt




5. predictf90 



important options used:


OPTION SNP_file genotypefile.txt
 OPTION chrinfo mapfile.txt
 OPTION include_effects 2
 OPTION missing -999



It runs properly until the option 1 to 4, but at the predictf90, I am getting wiered correlation, for example:


Trait:            1         549
     mean Y         -999.389849998043       var Y          1.426782420951955E-002
     mean Yhat     -9.018972706056467E-003  var Yhat       3.193376940400771E-003
     cov (Y,Yhat)  -3.035603192877908E-004  corr (Y,Yhat) -4.497187900814020E-002
  wrote bvs for animals in data in file "bvs.dat"




also bvs.dat file is empty but there is another file bvs2.dat, without only one column with list of animals. The yhat_residuals also looks awkward as:


     1347   -999.371033      0.000122   -999.000122
        509   -999.539795      0.000061   -999.000061
        938   -999.459167      0.000061   -999.000061
        571   -999.530334      0.000183   -999.000183
        500   -999.377136      0.000122   -999.000122
        480   -999.272339      0.000122   -999.000122
       2408   -999.459045      0.000061   -999.000061


I can see the values "y"  have that missing value -999. I have also tried with and without  the OPTION missing -999 at the step predictf90. 



Please let me know what could be the problem?
