Dear Shogo,

Thank you very much for your help.
I did download gnuplot.exe, wgnuplot.exe and wgnuplot.dll and put them in the same folder with all of the other files
and it worked.
However, I also have some question. could you please help me with this?
When the program asked me 
" Choose a graph for samples (= 1) or histogram (= 2); or exit (= 0)"

 1 # I chose 1

positions

1 2 # Following the instruction in the manual file, I put 1 and 2 , but I have no idea why we put it here. what do 1
and 2 mean in here?

On the other case:
 " Choose a graph for samples (= 1) or histogram (= 2); or exit (= 0)"

 2 # I chose 2 for the histogram

 Type	 position    and    #	 bins

1 20 # I also do not understand why we have 1 and 20 in here.

Thank you very much.
```
