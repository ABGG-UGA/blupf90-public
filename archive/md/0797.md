Hello Khanh,
Your problem is at the time very simple and very annoying.

THRGIBBS refuses to work individual which have only missing value.
All the tested individuals must have at least one value for the trait you study.
If not, THRGIBBS gives you the message you received.

You need to thoroughly clean your data and eliminate the individuals with missing value. Thus, the problem will be that those individuals will not be included in your analyse...

Hope I helped you,
Julien.
