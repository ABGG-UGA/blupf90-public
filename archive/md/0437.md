Â  Julie,

 The AIC is the REML log-likelihood + a penalization that depends on the number of parameters, which in reml estimators
is the number of variance components.

 However, the problem is in the REML likelihood, which integrates the "fixed" effects. So, if you want to compare fixed
effects, reml is not adequate because the likelihood is not trying to maximize the likelihood of fixed effects, only of
variance components. You would need an ML, not REML, estimator. However, REML might be a good approximation. 
 AIC in airemlf90 aims at comparing models with different variance components. Thus an alternative is to fit your fixed
effect as *random*, and then you're fine, and here's an example:

 < i> Short communication:</i> Analysis of association between the prion protein (< i> PRNP</i>) locus and milk traits
in Latxa dairy sheep
 ZG Vitezica, I Beltran de Heredia, E Ugarte
 Journal of dairy science 96 (9), 6079-6083

 If I remember correctly, QxPak, which is based in remlf90 does ML and REML.
