Sorry, I meant the "last_solutions" file (not "binary_final_solutions" file). The "binary_final_solutions" can be used
to restart the program and recalculate posterior means of solutions when we need to use all solution samples to
calculate posterior means using "OPTION solutions mean". But I don't recommend to use this option because we don't know
when the program converges at the first run. Anyway, those files are created as binary because we don't need to see
inside the solution files unless we need to investigate something special.
