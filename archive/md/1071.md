Hi Christos,
The inversion is done with LAPACK. Although it returns the error code if it has failed, it is hardly useful for users.
The problem is in the whole matrix, not in a specific row or column. Your matrix is okay in R so, the issue is in the
import of G-matrix to blupf90 through a text file.



Please make sure the value in the text file has enough digits. Roughly speaking, to represent the numerical value as
the same precision as computer software, the text format needs at least 12 significant digits. The standard is
double-precision which has 15-16 digits. If this is the problem, R also reproduces an error when the G-matrix is from
the text file.


Another possibility would be "tuning". The blupf90 program manipulates G after blending with A22, I, and J. This is
needed to align the scale of G to A22. If you do not have A22, please try the following option.



OPTION tunedG 0


If you have A22, the above option may result in biased prediction.
