Hi, I have a question; can DAIRYPAK accomondate a sire model? If so how does one specify the model to use? I have gone through the manual and it's not clear

  Well, you have matrices with the estimates of covariance components, Var(R) (residual) and Var(G) (genetic, or random) at the final lines of remlf90.

 Var(P)=Var(G)+Var(R). In the literature Var(G)=G_0 and Var(R)=R_0 .

 Genetic correlation is straightforward, cov(trait1,trait2)/sqrt(var(trait1)*var(trait2)) in matrix Var(G)  (re-read the definition of correlation). 

 Heritabilities are diagonals of Var(G)/Var(P).

 These questions are not appropriate for a list like this, before asking to the list you should try to read a good set of notes instead and work them out by yourself.

 Hi there, I need to know how can I estimate heritability, genetic and penotypic correlation out from results of remlf90?
