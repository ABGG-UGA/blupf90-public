  Â Dear Andres 
 Thank you for your answers. 
 I am currently running GWAS inÂ  GS3 using Windows executable, However, they appeared with "Fortran runtime error, end
of file",do I need to installed some fortrant software to run it? 

No. You may need an extra empty line at the end of the parameter file (or perhaps the data file?)
Is it correct thatÂ  I don't need to provide pedigree to run Baysian Variable selection?
 



Yes
Thank you. 
 Best regards 
 Duy Ngoc Do

Â Dear All
 I am Duy, i am currently working on feed efficiency in pig (for both GWAS and Genomic selection).
 I have read through papers "Genome-wide association mapping including phenotypes from relatives without genotype". I
wonder that there are some examples available for the method now?

 Yes:
