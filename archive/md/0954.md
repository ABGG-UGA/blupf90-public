There may be several reasons, but now I give 2 suggestions.
First, remove "OPTION residual 1" because the residual variance for binary traits is always 1, so you don't need this
option. Second, remove "OPTION solution mean". You can use this option to get posterior means of EBV, but I suggest to
estimate variance components first and then run thrgibbs1f90 again with "OPTION fixed_var mean" to avoid estimating
variances every time.



Next, rescaling continuous linear traits (e.g., standardization is one way but not necessary). One possible reason to
have zero (co)variances is that the scale is too large. If continuous observations are divided by something (e.g., SD),
the scale will be similar to binary traits. This is an easy way to avoid possible zero variances.
