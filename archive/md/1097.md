Hi,


The GIBBSF90 software is a Gibbs sampler for the Gaussian model. And, the Gibbs sampler is a special case of the MH
algorithm. The proposed value is always accepted in Gibbs sampling. See Sorensen and Gianola (2002) or the other formal
textbooks for Bayesian statistics for details.



The implementation is basically the same as Wang et al. (1993; GSE) with an extension to multivariate cases using
block-sampling techniques (Sorensen and Gianola, 2002). We use this approach because of its simplicity. The efficiency
of sampling heavily depends on the optimization level (Misztal, 2008). The program is accelerated with an efficient way
of matrix storage and the optimized code. Misztal (1999; Interbull bull) briefly mentioned the kernel of this program.
There is no further literature for detailed optimization, just because it might not be much scientific interest.


 I think GIBBSF90 software is fast enough, as a sequential computer program, for a model with pedigree (and genomic)
relationship matrices. It also supports various models without the loss of generality, which is also crucial idea
common in BLUPF90 programs.
