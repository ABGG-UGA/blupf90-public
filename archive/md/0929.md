I uploaded binaries to Linux/64bit_old/ on our website for old glibc users. I know that several users are still using
old servers, but I encourage to update glibc or upgrade OS.Â We may not update those binaries as we usually do because
we are not planning to keep our old servers with the old OS or libc for a long time.
