Hi all,
Thanks for Andres, I got that the SD from the thrgibbs1f90 can be used to calculate PEV for EBV. The question is that,
I used animal model to obtain EBV, would the accuracy that calculated from the resulted SD be still inflated because of
the animal model? Should I use the reduced animal model with thrgibbs1f90 to obtain the accuracy too? 
Thank you!
