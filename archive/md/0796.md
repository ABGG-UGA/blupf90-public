Dear everyone,

 My name is Khanh. I am a third year PhD. candidate in Montpellier University, France. I have been using BLUPF90 to apply genomic models for disease resistance trait.

 In order to estimate genomic (G_BLUP) heritability I ran AIREMLF90 and GIBBS1F90 and I have got the results.

 In my case, the data was set as binary variables (2 is survivor; 1 is dead), therefore, I would like to run THRGIBBS1F90 for variance estimation. However, when I applied THRGIBBS1F90, it was not work and it said that "All traits are missing; eliminate such as record". I have tried to look for information like this on the Internet but I have not fixed this problem.

 Could you take a quick look at my data sets (I took only first 200 values of renadd04.ped as well as renf90.dat), in order to give me your comments for next steps?

Best regards,

Khanh.
