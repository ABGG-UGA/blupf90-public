Hello, this is Sungbong Jang
Firstly, I'd like to say thank you guys who have made and supported these programs.
My question is that how can I put dam id as one of the random effects? not through the pedigree when I do ssBLUP.
I just put dam id into the data file and did renumf90 first, and then, tried to do airemlf90 to estimate heritability
and other genetic parameters, but it did not work.
I mean it converged too many rounds and never stopped.
I tried several options such as OPTION EM-REML 10, but it didn't work
Please let me know how to do this, thank you in advance.
