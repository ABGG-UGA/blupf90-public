Dear ,


I am PhD student of Animal Breeding in second year .I'd like to do linear quantile mixed model with milk records but 
there is not Software for it. The lqmm Package in R is for doing linear quantile mixed model but  the problem is
co-variance matrix structure (do not know A matrix) . Can you help me by manipulating the BLUPF90  for analysis linear
quantile mixed model.


Thanks,
Best Regards,
Hossein
