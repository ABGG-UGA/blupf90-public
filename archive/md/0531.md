Dear Shogo,

50,000 and 300,000 are from the graph and the postgibbs_sample file.
 


Choose a graph for samples (=1) or histogram (= 2); or exit (=0)
1
positions
1 2 3 


from the graph, the first value is 50,000 and the last value is 300,000


from postgibbs_sample file, the second colum, the first value also 50,000 and the last value is 300,000.


I have just give the input values as above post, and I am really want to have the burn-in from 0 to 250,000.


Thank you very much for your help.


I aslo tried to attached one captured image of the graph. I hope that it will work.
