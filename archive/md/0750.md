Hello,
I encounter a problem with the THRGIBBS familly.
For some reasons, these sofwares do not update the gibbs_samples filles which is quite annoying for running the
postgibbs software. 

Also when no gibbs_samples files are present, THR create a new one but do not write the samples in it.
What is strange is that THRGIBSS said that the samples are stored when the run finish...

Here is my parameter file as I maybe have overlook something :

# Parameter file for program renf90; it is translated to parameter
# file for BLUPF90 family programs.
