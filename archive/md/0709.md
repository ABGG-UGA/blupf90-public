Huimin,

I found there are 2 issues in your original parameter file. The first one is related to fixed effects. Just show the first few lines of EFFECTS block (i.e. fixed effects):

EFFECTS:
 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10       3799 cross 
 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11        82 cross  # calving 
 16 16 16 16 16 16 16 16 16        82 cov 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 
 17 17 17 17 17 17 17 17 17        82 cov 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 
 18 18 18 18 18 18 18 18 18        82 cov 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 
 19 19 19 19 19 19 19 19 19        82 cov 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 

I guess the first effect is HTD, and if so, what does the first line means? Each HTD effect will be separately estimated in each "trait" i.e. 9 different solutions can be calculated in each HTD level. This is true if it is what you want to do. If you want to group animals in different parity into one HTD level, there is no way to do this with this 9 trait model.

I guess the 2nd to 6th lines refer to fixed regressions nested within month (or age-month) of calving. Let's see the 2nd line, which means the fixed effect with same definition will be applied to each trait. The calving month (or age) should be different across parity. If you want to apply different calving effect to different parity, the specification should be changed. It can be done with this 9 trait model.

To short, by treating different parities as correlated effects, we can use more flexible model specifications. 

The second issue is from the sampling of residual covariance matrices. In the original parameter file, the residual covariance matrix is 9x9 and many off-diagonals are filled with 0. Note that GIBBS3F90 actually draw a full residual covariance matrix and then artificially put 0 to the elements corresponding to the original zero. That is, unneccessary parameters are sampled based on unnecessary statistics. With the suggested model, unnecessary parameters are naturally excluded from the sampling. So the number of parameters actually drawn in the sampling process is not the same in two models.

By the way, BLUPF90 programs basically build MME with missing observations using a standard way (e.g. explained in Dr. Mrode's book). See Dr. Misztal's course note for detailed description how the programs handle missing values. The note is found on the official dokuwiki.
