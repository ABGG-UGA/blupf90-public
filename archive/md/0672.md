Gonzalo,
There is no formal installer for the BLUPF90 programs. You can just download each program from the official site and
run it. BLUPF90 is DOS-type software so you will follow the typical DOS manner to install and invoke the program (e.g.
save the program in a directory listed in the PATH).

If you are unsure of DOS-like programs, the following is the easiest way to use the program.
Save all required files in a folder.
Download the program and store it to the same folder.Double click the program. A black window is popping up.
Input the name of parameter file in the black window using the keyboard. If the program asks you more questions, type
the answers.Wait for finishing the analysis. Don't close the black window. When the analysis ends, the windows will
automatically disappear.
Check the results. The program saves the results as files in the same directory.
I recommend a user to use the Command Prompt to run the BLUPF90 programs. The usage of Command Prompt is a FAQ. We can
find many explanatory web sites for this topic when asking Google.

Yutaka
