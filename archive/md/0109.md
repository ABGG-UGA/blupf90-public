Hi everyone,

 I'm having some problems trying to get blupf90 and airemlf90 to work. I
 have a data file with over 6000 observations and a pedigree file with
 around the same number of individuals. I'm using windows 7 and the
 latest versions of the programs. I have 1 trait, and a fixed effect with
 4 categories (most of the animals are in cat. 1 and 2, with very few for
 cat. 3 and 4). When I run them I get nothing. I'll attached the
 parameter file (par1.txt), I've been using and the data (Data1.txt) and
 pedigree files (Lped.txt).

 Any hint or suggestion would be greatly appreciated.

 Regards,

 Napo
