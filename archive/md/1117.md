Dear blupf90 group,
Wish to know if we could treat litter as a random effect in renumf90? Because referring from the manual, only permanent
environment effect, maternal effect and permanent maternal effect can be treat as extra random effect beyond additive
genetic effect.
In my case, I have pups born in different year but from the same bitch.
Thanks a lot in advance!
