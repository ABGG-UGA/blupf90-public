This requires a (possibly virtual) redefinition ofÂ  a random group. Instead of stating that the effects:
 5 6 7
 and then the address functions uses the effects 5, 6 and 7, the new definition is:
 5 3
 which means:
 starting from 5, for 3 effects
 The simplest change is in code that does correlated effects. Change it to works as "5 3" from "5 6 7".

  Â Dear all,

 I have a situation with a combination of random regresion and competition.

 The competition effect needs several "virtual" effects with 0 levels,
 which are grouped and need to be consecutive.

 On the other hand, each coeficient of the random regression is a
 competition effect itself. Thus, if I have, say, 3 coefficients for the
 RR, then I need three "blocks" of competition effects.

 The problem is in defining the random group, since it requires
 consecutive effects. I cannot find 3 consecutive "virtual" effects that
 at the same time belong to each of the three competition blocks.

 Is there a way out of this?

 Thanks in advance
