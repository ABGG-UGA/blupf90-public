## 1062: User defined G matrix

Dear all,
I have been testing several variations of GRMs focussing particularly on genotyping by sequencing data
Have GRMs in the following format: row id, col id, value corresponding to either the lower or upper triangular G matrix
In the BLUPF90 suite of programs been using the OPTION readG to load my G matrix
In several cases I get the message that the matrix is not positive definite, even though the matrix can be inverted e.g
in R
Have the following questions:
1. Is it possible to trace the error source? E.g next to the message that the matrix is not positive definite I get a
number
2. Been experimenting with blending options in order to make the matrix invertible. However, no matter what choices I
made I get always the initial error. Even in the extreme scenario of using alpha = 0 the problem persists. Or even more
strikingly if I consider a,b and delta as 0 and have gamma as 1 supposedly ending up with an Identity matrix I still
get the initial error. From the starting info BLUPF90 gives I can see that my blending options are active.
Kind Regards,Christos
