Hi, this is my first post. So, i hope do this from better way possible.I have always worked with genotype environment
interaction (GEI), usually, hierarchical reaction norm models (HRNM). That are implemented based on the unknown
covariate proposition of Su et al. (2006). These covariates are characterized by the Contemporary Groups (GC) effects
that are jointly estimated with the RN of the animals. In beef cattle, CG combines location, climate, management, and
sex and is the most basic environmental entity to which the performance of the animals is the subject and, therefore, a
natural candidate RN covariate.It turns out that sometimes the variance of gc oscillates a lot, presenting many
discrepant peaks. And sometimes the residual variance goes to zero, and I've never figured out why that happens.Could
someone tell me how to solve these problems?
