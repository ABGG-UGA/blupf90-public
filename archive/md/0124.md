 First, you should change your id numbes to smaller integers (e.g., 1 to n). These are too large.
 You had errors in your parameter file.Â  Indeed, you need many more iterations (>100,000).
 Should read as follows (yes there is a blank line below "pedigree file"):

 DATAFILE

 PEDIGREE FILE

 GENOTYPE FILE

  Â Dear  Andres and others
Thank you very much for your answer. However, I found an error that happens in GS3 (At line 1034 of file GS3.f90 (unit
= 10, file = "DDPHE.par", fortran run error, but inter for item 1 in list input). 
I just wanted run Bayes Variable Selection for 1000 loci of 879 animals (to find out significant SNPs for trait),
phenotype file (DDRFI1PHE.txt) have 5 columns including id, section, pen, trait, and weighted factor. I just wondered
that without pedigree, do I need to add effects of named perm_diagonal in parameter file or did I do somethings wrong
in parameter file?
Thank you for your helps. 
Best regards 
Duy Ngoc Do

Â Dear Andres 
 Thank you for your answers. 
 I am currently running GWAS inÂ  GS3 using Windows executable, However, they appeared with "Fortran runtime error, end
of file",do I need to installed some fortrant software to run it? 

No. You may need an extra empty line at the end of the parameter file (or perhaps the data file?)
Is it correct thatÂ  I don't need to provide pedigree to run Baysian Variable selection?
 



Yes
Thank you. 
 Best regards

Â Dear All
 I am Duy, i am currently working on feed efficiency in pig (for both GWAS and Genomic selection).
 I have read through papers "Genome-wide association mapping including phenotypes from relatives without genotype". I
wonder that there are some examples available for the method now?

 Yes:

 "exercises"
 Any upcoming course (in Europe for BLUPF90 ? 




 Nope, there was one in Italy in february.

 Andres
 Thank
