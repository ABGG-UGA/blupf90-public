Â Hi Andres,

I have started aireml from a converged remlf90 (EM) run with the option EM-REML 10. so the initial values are fine. I have a small data set and saw that the covariance matrix at a convergence criterion 10^-8 are vastly different from what I get at 10^-10. Basically, I do not trust the results I get from the remlf90 run. that is why I started an aireml run. 


 But the thing is, if your data set is small then you may need a very strong convergence criteria. Also, if the likelihood is very flat you can get different results with (almost) same likelihood. 
 OTOH, AI-reml does make an approximation of normality of Fisherian Information matrix. For small data sets or in the limits of the boundary space, this approximation fails. Then EMREML (and also Gibbs) is a safer procedure.

 Andres




thanks Chris
