Most probably you are reading just one column, because column may be separated by TABs instead of spaces. this is the
first field  "1 0 0 1946" with length equal 10 ... 
the other 2 len=50 corresponds to missing fields.

 Ok, what does that mean:

 Error!! Id with length > nlen was found
 Use --alpha_size paramter !!!
 1 0 0 1946

 Lengths: 10 50 50

 I tried to change the alpha_size to 50 after that I have this:
