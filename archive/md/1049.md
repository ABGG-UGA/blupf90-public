Rama,

Try to pass those statements to the Linux environment before you run blupf90:


ulimit -s unlimitedexport OMP_STACKSIZE=128M

Â Dear Legarra and the usersÂ 


There has been some recent update in blupf90 family programs (From Feb, 2019 and also in March, 2019). With these
modules I am unable to run : postGS90 option. Every time I receive the message :
"Â forrtl: severe (41): insufficient virtual memory "


and the programÂ stops at :Â 


*------------------------*
* Setup Genomic Done !!! *
*------------------------*


Solutions read from file: "solutions"




I am pretty sure, this is not the problem with memory as I have tried with 16G to 48G memory in the server. Exactly
same options and the model ran with previous postGSf90 without any error.Â 


If anyone faced such problems ?


Thanks,
Rama Bangera
