Firstly,
Sorry for the extreme delay in my answer. I had to focus on another subject for the previous weeks.

To answer your queries :
-Indeed, I try to do a multi-trait analysis with 7 of them.
-Again, you are right, the animal genetic effect should affect all the traits.
-Yes. It is my aim.

Thank you again for using some of your time,
Julien.
