Hello,

When running gibbs2f90 with 

printf "ParameterFile.txt \n 500 100 \n 10 \n" | gibbs2f90 > output.log & disown   
 #rounds burn-in, samples stored
I am unable to figure out the correct input for postgibbsf90. Naively, I use postgibbsf90, insert the Parameterfile
again, set as burn-in 100 and as n-th sample 10. When it did not work, I used 0 as suggested on
http://nce.ads.uga.edu/wiki/doku.php?id=readme.postgibbs. This is the error message I receive:
     postgibbsf90
      name of parameter file?ParameterFile.txt

     ParameterFile.txt
      POST-GIBBSF90 3.06
       # parameters in gibbs_samples =		75
      Read	    40	samples from round	   110	to	   500
      Burn-in?
     100
      Give n to read every n-th sample? (1 means read all samples)
     10
      Every n-th stored in gibbs_samples	  10
      Try again!!! check burn-in > the first sample
      # actual samples =	  30	 # samples for burn-in		10

The other variant is
     postgibbsf90
      name of parameter file?ParameterFile.txt
     
     ParameterFile.txt
      POST-GIBBSF90 3.06
       # parameters in gibbs_samples =		75
      Read	    40	samples from round	   110	to	   500
      Burn-in?
     0
      Give n to read every n-th sample? (1 means read all samples)
     10
      Every n-th stored in gibbs_samples	  10
      Try again!!! check burn-in > the first sample
      # actual samples =	  40	 # samples for burn-in		 0


I tried several variants with postgibbsf90, like burn-in 111 or 200 and n-th sample 1 or 5 or 10 or 20, but nothing
makes it work for me. I sometimes receive different error messages. 

It works for me as long as I keep the "n-th sample" parameter = 1 with both gibbs2f90 and postgibbsf90. As I will be
using a long chain, I would like to not store every sample.
Can you please explain to me what I do wrong? What would be the correct entries?
I would really appreciate any help!

Thank you,Katrin
