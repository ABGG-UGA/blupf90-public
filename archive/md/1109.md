Dear all,


I'm trying to estimate variance of maternal genetic and maternal permanent environmental effects. Asremlf90 worked with
the model only including additive genetic effect. However, when the model additionally included maternal genetic effect
only or both maternal effects, asremlf90 and remlf90 reported segmentation fault. I can't find out the reason.


Attachments are the parameter file for the model with maternal genetic effect and data files. 


Thank you! Looking forward to your reply!


Sincerely,
Huimin Kang
