 Dear list,

 I have observed strange results for S.E. reported by AIREMLF90.

 Here is a reproducible example. 
 I have simulated a simple dataset (attached) where I have a response normal variable depending an a 3-level factor.
 The parameter file is very basic:
DATAFILE
 data
 NUMBER_OF_TRAITS
 1
 NUMBER_OF_EFFECTS
 1
 OBSERVATION(S)
 1
 WEIGHT(S)

 EFFECTS: POSITIONS_IN_DATAFILE NUMBER_OF_LEVELS TYPE_OF_EFFECT [EFFECT NESTED]
 2 3 cross
 RANDOM_RESIDUAL VALUES
 10
 OPTION sol se
 
 I fit this linear model with both AIREMLF90 and REMLF90.
 But while I get the very same ML estimates for the levels, the S.E. are orders of magnitude different.
 namely, O(13) and O(0.07) respectively.

 Fitting the linear model with R confirms that REMLF90 results of O(0.07) are correct.
 Besides, O(13) seems too much, as I simulated a 1000 values.

 I am using 
 AI-REMLF90 ver. 1.109
 and
 REMLF90  ver. 1.78

 from what (I believe) are the latest binaries for Linux 32 bit [1].

 Thank you!
