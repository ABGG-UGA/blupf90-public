Dear blupf90 group:
	I am really interested in ssGWAS. Recently, I read the paper "Frequentist p-values for large-scale-single step
genome-wide association, with an application to birth weight in American Angus cattle"	published one month ago. I
tried to use the method in my PhD project to get P value by ssGWAS, but I feel confused about some problems.
	Firstly, my steps for ssGWAS  were    1) "renumf90 par.txt"    2) modified the renf90.par and run "airemlf90
renf90.par" to estimate genetic variance   3)	 "pregsf90 renf90.par"	   4) "blupf90 renf90.par"    5) "postgsf90
renf90.par". But, I'm not sure if my steps are correct. Could you help me see is that the correct steps?
	Secondly, when I did ssGWAS following above steps, I noticed that are  some issues with the Manhattan plot,
because  most of P-values  in output file "chrsnp_pval" are showed "Infinity".	  So -log10 of	the P-values showed
error in R  Manhattan plots.	Could you please tell me what the problem is ?	why most of P-values  in output file
"chrsnp_pval" are showed "Infinity"?
       Thanks for your attention.  I am looking forward to get your reply.
       Thank you!
