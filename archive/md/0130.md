 Amir,
 first, you need to understand how to use renumf90 with examples in the documentation and the wiki.
 Then, you need to modify the output files from QmSim to work as input files of renumf90. For instance, there are headers in QmSim files but not in renumf90. Also, genotypes are not coded in the same way.
 You'll need to program it in R, SAS, or your language of choice.
