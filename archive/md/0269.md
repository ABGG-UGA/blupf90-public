As Andres says, I think you can include animals with all zero observations when you run blupf90.

 If you need to predict breeding values for animals with no phenotypes and no genotypes, those breeding values are parent averages, so you don't have to include those animals in the input data file. Instead you can include them in the pedigree file (e.g., using ped_depth 0 with renumf90, you will have all related animals in your renaddxx.ped). And run blupf90 to predict breeding values for all animals in the pedigree file.
