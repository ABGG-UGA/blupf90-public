Hi-


Is it possible to do a GWAS using postgsf90 if you already have a file of deregressed breeding values to use as a
starting point? I already have the PTA, pedigree, and marker files, but the PTA were NOT estimated using other UGA
programs, so I don't have, for example, a solutions file. Do we need to run a round of iteration with pregsf90 and one
of the REML programs to get all of the matrices set-up, and then replace that solutions file with our phenotypes
(deregressed PTA) file?

Any suggestions are appreciated!



Best wishes,

John
