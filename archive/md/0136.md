Hi everyone,

 I am new to the blupf90 programs and would like to fit a nested effect for a factor within a factor (owner of herd
nested within region). The only way I found to fit a nested effect in the renumf90 parameter documentation is to make
the effect a covariate. Is there another way to make the effect nested? Thanks for any help!

 Sincerely,

 Kayla
