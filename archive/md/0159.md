```
 The first case is a single trait model
 The second is a two trait models (1st trait for high and 2nd trait for low)
 You need two parameter files and two data files, one organised as

 trait1

 and the other as 

 trait1 trait2

 There are examples of single trait and multiple trait in the documentation and also in the examples of the
distribution. Try first those

 Dear all,
I would like to compare -2 log likelihoods between one model assuming homogeneous variances and another one
heterogeneous (genetic and residual). I have two environments: 1) high and 2) low standard deviation for milk yield.
Can anyone help on how to write the syntax in Blupf90?


Thanks in advance
