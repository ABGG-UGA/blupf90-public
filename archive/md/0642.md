 Few comments in addition to Shogo's answer which covers the typical cases. This is defnitely a FAQ.
 Gibbs sampler will give you a posterior distribution of h2, which is more descriptive than the s.d. specially with
little data or low h2.
 A way of testing heritability is using likelihood ratio test. Fit two models in rEML, one with genetic effect genetic
variance (H1) and another one without genetic effect. Then the difference between the two , which is a positive number,
is a LRT statistic which follows a mixture of chi-2 distributions as detailed by Visscher "A Note on the Asymptotic
Distribution of Likelihood Ratio Tests to Test Variance Components". The theory of the LRT can be found in standard
books and a nice description is in Sorensen & Gianola book.

 Output of airemlf90 under H0 is x=-2logL ; output under H1 is y=-2logL. These are positive numbers, so the smaller the
better;Â  y<x as H1 is a more complex (so more likely) model
 The LRT test is x-y 

 then, the pvalue is (in R) : 
 pchisq(x-y,1,lower.tail=FALSE)/2Â

Â Hi, Â Iâ€™m new to AIREMLF90 and want to clarify my understanding of how to evaluate significance of the heritability
estimated from genetic variance in this software. Apologies if this question has been addressed already, my searches
didn't turn up any answers. Â For this example, Iâ€™ve analyzed a single trait in offspring from a diallel cross.
Relevant details of the model are here:EFFECTS: POSITIONS_IN_DATAFILE NUMBER_OF_LEVELS TYPE_OF_EFFECT[EFFECT NESTED]Â 
2Â Â Â Â Â Â  184 crossRANDOM_TYPEÂ add_animal Â then I estimated heritability as:OPTION se_covar_function H2
G_1_1_1_1/(G_1_1_1_1+R_1_1)So far so good, the heritability estimates are similar to estimates from other software and
this function matches the direct calculation (genetic variance/total variance) from the output. Â Now the question: Â
How should we evaluate whether the estimated heritability is significantly different from zero? It would be ideal to
calculate a p-value but 95% confidence intervals would be sufficient. Can 95% confidence intervals be calculated from
the reported â€œSample SDâ€? Â  Can anyone point me toward a resource that addresses this? Thanks for any advice, Â
-Eli Â
