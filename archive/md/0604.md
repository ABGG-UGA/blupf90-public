```
Because the estimates are in log scale, so, in your case, you can calculate residual variances with

exp(-4.9776*z1+(-0.32965)*z2)


where z1 and z2 are values corresponding to positions 2 and 3 in your data file. You can calculate heterogeneous
residual variances by changing the values within the range.
