Usually, 10000 iterations are not good enough to estimate (co)variance components but depending on the data size and
the model used. When you determine convergence of the job using 3 separate runs, you need to use different seeds.
Otherwise, you’ll get very similar results. To check the convergence, you should use some statistics from
postgibbsf90.

 With the fixed_var option, usually we don’t need > 10000 iterations. If you get very fluctuated solutions, it is
likely that variance components used in the parameter file are not good for your data sets to estimate solutions.
 When you compare solutions, you should see only differences between solutions (e.g., diff(u1 - u2) in run 1 and
between diff(u1 - u2) in run 2 (not absolute values).
