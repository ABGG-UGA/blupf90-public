Â Thank Andres. I really appreciated.
 Is it possible for me to ask if there is any available document which can help me to calculate the heritability from
the results of THRGIBBSF90?
 I did search on the internet but I could not get the proper one.
 Is it correct if I use the results from postgibbs_samples file to calculate the distribution of heritability?
 Thanks.
