You can try airemlf90 with EM-REML n where n can be large enough to reach the convergence, and then put those estimates
in your parameter file and run airemlf90 again. If you still cannot get the convergence with airemlf90, I suggest you
should change the model. I guess you may not have enough information to use 3rd order polynomials or effects in the
model including fixed effects do not fit well.If airemlf90 does not work and If you need any results, try gibbs2f90.
You can get something.
