Professor Ignacy,
when I runned the Gibbs1f90 with a regular pedigree and with a empty file the results are different even I had used the
OPTION readGimA22i for both analysis. How the GimA22i is the last matrix formed by the program I would expect the same
result for both, because the pedigree wouldn't have any influence on the inverse weighted G matrix formed. Using the
OPTION readGimA22i, do I need to necessarily provide the A matrix and the  "x.dat_XrefID" file? I'm not sure that the
program is reading correctly and doing the calculations only with the matrix that I provided (GimA22i), is there any
other influences? Thank you again, best wishes,
Raphael Rocha Wenceslau.

 The best way to do it in the current system is to use an empty pedigree file.

is there any way to use the Gibbs1f90 providing the G matrix or the inverse of the G matrix (already done) with no
pedigree file or A matrix? Thank you,
