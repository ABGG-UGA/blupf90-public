 Vinicius, 11 traits imply 50 covariances. Estimating that accurately with 192 records is impossible.
 For the model, I think that you have three variance components (varriety, population, progeny), that is three random
effects.

 Hi all, 

My colleagues and I are performing a multi-trait analysis considering 11 traits using 192 records.


We are intending to fit a mixed model with progeny nested into population that is nested into variety
(variety/population/progeny). All this factors are crossclassified. Is there a way to fit such model using remlf90? 

 
Besides these factors (fitted as random) we are also considering block as random and overall mean as fixed.
