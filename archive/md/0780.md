Hello all
I am running an analysis with simulated data and 25 replicates for genomic selection.
When I am using RENUMF90 program, it asks me the name of parameter file that I have to feed manually.
However, for 50K data and 25 replicates, it's not always possible to feed the name of parameter file always, while
automation.
I tried in Linux (R) following command in script
system("./renumf90 renumf.par")

it doesn't work, it again asks for parameter file name, however, for preGSf90, the same command works and automatically
reads the parameter file::::::::::::::: system("./preGSf90 renf90.par")


What is the solution for this problem?
How to make program read the parameter file for renumf90 program automatically?


Thanks and regards,
```
