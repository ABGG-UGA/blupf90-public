The number of the rows in the solutions file is related to your model,check in the renf90.par the number of levels for
each effect and the number of equations (rows in your solution file minus one due to header) will be equal to the
sum(number_of_levels)*number_of_traits

here the documentation for blupf90 and different examples

Thanx for the answer, Ignacio. 

So, if I have 2 effects, the solutions file  has two times more rows than the file renadd04.ped.is that correct? 

I my case, I got 1 effect, and the difference between the 2 files (number of rows) was 10%.

solutions file contains all the solution estimates for all effects
regular solutions file contains 4 columns1 trait
2 effect
3 level
4 solution
( if OPTION sol se  column #5  SE) 


in your case effect 4 (renadd04.ped) so you need to extract rows for col2==4 from the solutions files
< br>
for example using the following command in a unix terminal: 


awk '$2==4' solutions  > newfile

Hi Everybody, 

 

After running airemlf90, i noticed that the file SOLUTIONS and the file RENADD04.PED  contains different number of
rows.
Is that correct? 

regards, 

Henrique
