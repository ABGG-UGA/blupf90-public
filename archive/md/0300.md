 Sex and overall mean are confounded. The model is not full rank, because there are no individuals without sex, or in other words, the incidence matrix of mean is equal to incidence matrix of "male" plus incidence matrix of "female". REML founds this and nullifies the equation for the mean, which results in a solution of 0 and an s.e. of 0. The same will happen with generation.
 The more complex the models, the more you have this. When you have herd-year-season-number of parity + sex + age*year +... finding out what is estimable and what is not is a nightmare. But EBVs and estimable functions are always estimable :-)
 To adress these problems SAS users use "LSmeans" but often I found them to make little sense.

 I can't remember if one can get *contrasts* and their s.e. (e.g. male-female) between levels in Reml (Shogo, Ignacio, can we?), 
 but in Gibbs you can with 
OPTION solution all 1 2 3(in the wiki) and then compute constrats a posteriori as (male - female).

 Dear all,

 I'm a bit confused about the parameterization of the fixed part of the models.
 Let's say I have a couple of covariates: sex + generation.
 By running either remlf90 or airemlf90 I get the corresponding estimates of these fixed effects together with their s.e.

 However, I would like to have an estimate of the overall mean, and its s.e.
 I need an intercept. I tried to introduce it manually, using a column of ones I get it estimated as zero with s.e. = 0.

 Is it possible to use alternative parameterizations like this one?

 Thank you.
