 Well, you have matrices with the estimates of covariance components, Var(R) (residual) and Var(G) (genetic, or random)
at the final lines of remlf90.

 Var(P)=Var(G)+Var(R). In the literature Var(G)=G_0 and Var(R)=R_0 .

 Genetic correlation is straightforward, cov(trait1,trait2)/sqrt(var(trait1)*var(trait2)) in matrix Var(G)  (re-read
the definition of correlation). 

 Heritabilities are diagonals of Var(G)/Var(P).

 These questions are not appropriate for a list like this, before asking to the list you should try to read a good set
of notes instead and work them out by yourself.

 Hi there, I need to know how can I estimate heritability, genetic and penotypic correlation out from results of
remlf90?
