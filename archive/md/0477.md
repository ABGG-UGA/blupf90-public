If the program was accidentally interrupted, you need to run from the beginning.If you are running gibbs2f90 for
genetic evaluation (BLUP), you don't need to run a half million rounds. Assuming you already have known variances, run
the program with


OPTION fixed_var mean


You need to run just 5000-10000 rounds.


If you need to estimate variances first, run the program with no options (and with 0 burn-in). Usually, you don't need
to run a half million rounds unless you have a lot of missing traits with a multiple trait model. Try 100000 rounds at
first and run postgibbsf90 to check the convergence. If you decided to run more, use "OPTION cont 100000". Before
running the program with this option, you should make copies of all output files somewhere else because all output
files will be replaced. If you made mistakes, you can't rerun with this option.


Once you estimated the variances, run the program again with "OPTION fixed_var mean" using estimated variances as
described above.
