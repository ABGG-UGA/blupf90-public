Steven,
The current BLUPF90 doesn't provide such a feature. But it is still possible if you modify the source file and compile
it. You can find the source code at http://nce.ads.uga.edu/wiki/doku.php?id=distribution (see the link to "package").

Even if you write a program and obtain a block of inverse, the block may not contain what you really want. BLUPF90
(actually the substantial subroutine FSPAK) doesn't calculate the full inverse. It calculates selected elements of the
inverse corresponding to the nonzero entries of the original MME. If the original block contains many zeros, the
results also contains many zeros.

Yutaka
