Hi Jan,

If the average inbreeding coefficient is exactly 1, the population has no genetic variation. All animals have the same
genotypes. In this case, A-matrix is singular and its inverse doesn't exist. Even when a pair of identical twins is
included, the relationship matrix is singular. If the population is assumed not to be completely inbred, you can use
0.9 or 0.95 instead of 1.
