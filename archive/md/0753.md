Thanks for reporting the issue, we can replicate the problem. Version 1.116 have a correction for this bug. 
In the meantime you can create a new variable in awk for example .

Dear,


I have an error with the latest version of renumf90 (1.114) that I don't have with version 1.111 :


$ renumf90 
 RENUMF90 version 1.114
 name of parameter file?renum_aireml.par
 renum_aireml.par
 n_comb 	  1
 ERROR in a "COMBINE" block



I have these two lines on the top of the parameter file : 
COMBINE 15 8 12
COMBINE 16 11 12


The problem seems to come from these lines but I don't understand because it works with the previous version.


Thanks in advance
Regards,
Julie
