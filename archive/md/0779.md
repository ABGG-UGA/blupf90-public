Most likely this cannot be done without slight changes to the program. You can check whether 
 RANDOM GROUP
 7 8 9
 does what you want but I am not sure.

 The other option would be to define covariables that result in uncorrelatedÂ  regressions in a model without a
competitive effect and then assume no correlations with competitive effects.

 There is another formulation of a competition model with two effects only no matter the number of competitors. Not yet
published.
