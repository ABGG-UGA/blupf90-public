 Current version accepts 1,000,000 snps so it should work now.

  ¬ Thanks for this Andres, I have it working now. Another quick question, I have some data that I‚Äôm working on that
is 50k, but I also want to make use of some HD cattle genotypes. I wondered if the bug in the program when more than
500k SNPs are used has been fixed yet? ¬ Thanks,Alex ¬ From: blupf90@yahoogroups.com [mailto:blupf90@yahoogroups.com]

 ¬ ¬ This is a weird bug related to sampling the variances and very little data. The subroutine sampling chi squared
deviates cannot use -2 as degrees of freedom with so little data.
 ¬ Put "4" as degrees of freedom for the initial variances, this is a low value that won't get you in trouble
 If you want to use an animal effect, you need to put a pedigree file !!! Hence the "File does not exist"

¬ Hi Andres,¬ Thanks for your reply. I‚Äôve replaced the column you mentioned with a vector of numbers. The program
does now recognise the 6 records in the data file, but the program still stalls at the same point as before. If you
have any other ideas please let me know.¬ Cheers,Alex¬ From: blupf90@yahoogroups.com [mailto:blupf90@yahoogroups.com]

¬ ¬ There is an "F" in your data file, and the read statements only read numbers. This may be the problem.On 11/10/15

¬ Hi,¬ I‚Äôm currently trying to run a BayesCPi model in GS3. I‚Äôve used example files from the Feb 2013 course in
Padova as a template for my own files, but I can‚Äôt get them to run correctly. When I look at the log, the program
does not seem to be recognising any records in the datafile (‚Äúdata file: testPheno_gs3.txt¬ ¬ ¬ ¬  with:¬ ¬  0
records‚Äù), and I assume its as a result of this that the program stops at ‚Äútransforming yZW ->multiplyweighted =
T‚Äù and never starts any iterations - it doesn‚Äôt give me an error, it just never moves past this point. Can anyone
advise me what it is that I‚Äôve done wrong to stop this from working? Data files etc are attached. This is based on a
small test data set so the number of iterations etc is much smaller than I would use for a proper run.¬ Also, I tried
to add an animal effect (1 add_animal 10), but whenever I try to include this in the parameter file I get a fortran
error ‚Äì ‚ÄúAt line 272 of file ../src/gs3.f90 (unit = 7, file = ‚Äò”±∆ö√≥‚Äô) Fortran runtime error: File ‚Äò‚Äô does
not exist‚Äù. If anyone could tell me what causes this and what I can do to avoid it I‚Äôd also be really grateful.¬
Best wishes,Alex
