Huimin,
My previous post was totally wrong, sorry. The following post should be correct.

Actually I have tried very similar model you are using and I found very reasonable results.

Now I understand what is going on. I think this problem comes from the data format as well as from the parameter file (it was not actually correct). Let's see a single-trait, three-parity, random regression model. In this model, we should prepare the data file as follows.

1. The data file should contain only 1 column for test-day records because it is a single-trait model (even if you have multiple-parity).
2. Additive genetic (or PE) effects are correlated among parities but they should be defined separately in each parity.

We assume a cow (ID=20236) with 2 records in the 1st parity, 3 records in the 2nd parity and 2 records 3rd parity. The corresponding data for this cow should be as follows.

20.0   20236     0     0    67   1
25.0   20236     0     0    98   1
31.0       0 20236     0    45   2
36.0       0 20236     0    74   2
42.0       0 20236     0   105   2
27.0       0     0 20236    37   3
29.0       0     0 20236    65   3

where column 1=observations; column 2=animal for 1st parity; column 3=animal for 2nd parity; column 4=animal for 3rd parity, column 5=polynomial values (covariates), column 6=fixed effect class. We assume the model:

y = fixed effect + genetic regressions + PE regressions + e

Pieces of the parameter file can be as follows.

NUMBER_OF_TRAITS
 1
...
OBSERVATION(S)
 1
...
EFFECTS:
 6   100 cross  # fixed effect
 2 20236 cross  # Parity1: genetic intercept
 5 20236 cov 2  # Parity1: genetic linear regression
 3 20236 cross  # Parity2: genetic intercept
 5 20236 cov 3  # Parity2: genetic linear regression
 4 20236 cross  # Parity3: genetic intercept
 5 20236 cov 4  # Parity3: genetic linear regression
 2 20236 cross  # Parity1: PE intercept
 5 20236 cov 2  # Parity1: PE linear regression
 3 20236 cross  # Parity2: PE intercept
 5 20236 cov 3  # Parity2: PE linear regression
 4 20236 cross  # Parity3: PE intercept
 5 20236 cov 4  # Parity3: PE linear regression
...
RANDOM_GROUP    # for additive genetic
 2 3 4 5 6 7
...
RANDOM_GROUP    # for PE
 8 9 10 11 12 13
...


The point is: parities should be considered as correlated "effects", not correlated "traits". You can easily extend above example to the 3-trait random regression model.

FYI: In above example, I assume that the covariate for intercept is 1. If you use the "typical" Legendre polynomials you prepared, the parameter file could be following (assuming columns 7 and 8 have covariates).

EFFECTS:
 6   100 cross  # fixed effect
 7 20236 cov 2  # Parity1: genetic intercept
 8 20236 cov 2  # Parity1: genetic linear regression
 7 20236 cov 3  # Parity2: genetic intercept
 8 20236 cov 3  # Parity2: genetic linear regression
 7 20236 cov 4  # Parity3: genetic intercept
 8 20236 cov 4  # Parity3: genetic linear regression
 7 20236 cov 2  # Parity1: PE intercept
 8 20236 cov 2  # Parity1: PE linear regression
 7 20236 cov 3  # Parity2: PE intercept
 8 20236 cov 3  # Parity2: PE linear regression
 7 20236 cov 4  # Parity3: PE intercept
 8 20236 cov 4  # Parity3: PE linear regression
