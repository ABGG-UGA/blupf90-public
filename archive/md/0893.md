I recommend not to use "OPTION solution mean" because you should estimate variance components first.

What do you mean the program did not work, stopped with an error message? The option should work. But I don't recommend
using the the degree of belief >5 or >10. How did you get the value "24"?


The program assumes missing observation = 0.


You can add an arbitrary value to your continuous trait (e.g., add 1, 10, 100, ...).
