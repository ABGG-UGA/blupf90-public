Dear all,
 I have a problem with obtaining progsf90 in the first place. 
  I feel a bit like I am missing something, but perhaps there is a real problem on the website. 


 Links to download the BLUPF90 and related programs point here: http://nce.ads.uga.edu/ html/projects/programs/


 The Readme in that directory says you can simply install by doing, e.g. tar xzvf progsf90.tar.gz

 
That would be fine, but I don't see a progsf90.tar.gz. In addition, within each directory, e.g. under Mac_OSX/ each
individual program comes with some extension *.dms I've never seen before and can't seem to track down. 

 
Mac OS X 10.12.6. Command line tools and gfortran installed. 


Please can someone help to set me straight or point me in the right direction? 

 
Thanks so much,


Marnin
