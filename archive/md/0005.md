```
I am a Mac user, but new in Unix terminal. I tried the Mac version of BLUPF90 and got an error message in RENUMF90:
"Error in nums splitting string starting:" followed by a line of data. I tried the same parameter, pedigree and data
files in Windows version by using Windows version under Windows XP Professional in VMWare Fusion. RENUMF90 run smoothly
and prepared the resulting files. 

 Is this a bug, or something I missed in Unix?
