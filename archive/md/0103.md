Hello all,

 I would like to do a bivariate analysis using gibbs1f90, but first I want to use renumf90.

 I don´t know how to do the parameter file, because my first trait is fitted by random regression with two random
effects: animal and permanent environment. 
 The second trait don´t use random regression and have only one random effect (animal).

 Could you please help me?
