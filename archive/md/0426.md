 Hi Marcelo,

 diagonal terms are inbreeding coefficients. If you do not have a deep and very complete pedigree, most of them will be
0. However with G, you see many small inbreeding coefficients. This explains the low correlation.
 However, in off-diagonals high values are due to sibs and parent-offspring pairs, with values like 0.25 and 0.5. These
relationships are usually well captured in the pedigree.

Â Hi there,running BLUPF90, I noticed a very low correlation (close to zero) between G and A22 diagonal terms. However,
correlations between all terms and off-diagonal terms were 0.77 and 0.73, respectively.Â 
Is it possible to have a so low correlation for the diagonal terms, if other correlations are moderate to high?
Regards,
Marcelo Freitas
