   I want to import the H matrix for REMLF90, as I am comparing alternative methods of weighting G not available in other options.  it appears the best way to do this is with tricks as suggested in the documentation of PreGSF90.  I have 3 questions before I start:  1) The documentation for user_defined_files_for_covariances_of _random_effects first indicates the following  user_file if the file contains the inverse of the covariance structure, that is, it contains T-1 ,user_file_inv if the file contains the covariance structure, that is, it contains T. If this is the case, T is inverted, Is this correct, it seems backward, i.e. if the option to use user_file, is specified, the file contains the inverse, where as if one uses the option user_file_inv, the original matrix is input? 

 Yes. "inv" means "invert this for me" (I agree this is not very elegant)
  2) Below is the example given in the documentation  RANDOM_GROUP# genomic2RANDOM_TYPEuser_fileFILE# matrix fileGi  So if I want to import the H matrix where I have 2 traits, would the parameter files look like this, where hmatrix.txt is the H matrix stored in ail format?   RANDOM_GROUP3RANDOM_TYPEuser_fileFILEhmatrix.txt(CO)VARIANCES1.0 .2.2 1.0



 Hmatrix should contain the INVERSE of H.
  3) If the inverse were input (not sure why one would do this),



 Often it is simpler to obtain the inverse than the matrix itself (e.g., an autocorrelation structure or Fernando-Grossmann).
 Also it is more efficient to create the inverse from outside, e.g. with R, and at the same time verify the positive-definiteness, etc.
 it would have to be in double precision to avoid rounding errors.  Does the program accept input in double precision format?



 Yes

  Thanks for your help, Bill
