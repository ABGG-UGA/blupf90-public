Thanks Ignacy.


This holds for (co)variances as well? In the Varona et al. paper it appears that an inverted Wishart distribution was
assumed for the genetic distribution and an inverted chi square assumed for residual and other random effects. 

Also, how are degree of belief parameters to be interpreted within the software? For instance, what does a degree of
belief of "5" represent? 


Thank you for helping me understand this.
