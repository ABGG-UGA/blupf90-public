Hi Deng Fei


Probably the model is too complicated compared with an amount of data or the model does not fit to the data. Possible
solutions include 1) to simplify the model, 2) to change the effects in the model, 3) to change the staring values or
use "OPTION EM-REML" to stabilize the staring values.
