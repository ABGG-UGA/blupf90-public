Dear all,
I am comparing linear and threshold models for visual scores at weaning and at yearling in beef cattle. The first phase
(weaning) includes genetic maternal and maternal permanent environment effects. Visual scores ranging from 1 to 5 and
were attributed by trained examiners, always relative to average animals within each management group. Thus, the scores
(notes) distributions is close to: note 1 = 10%; note 2 = 20%; note 3 = 40%; note 4 = 20% and note 5 = 10%, approaching
to the normal distribution. Using the linear model I had no problems in reaching convergence at both ages (weaning and
yearling). However, with threshold model only achieved convergence the analyses with visual scores at yearling. For
scores at weaning I am unable to obtain the convergence, and already ran the software several times. Moreover, I am
doing two-traits analysis including a linear trait (weight) with each visual score (as threshold), using the results
(variances) obtained with the linear model for each visual score as initial values. Even so, the convergence was not
reached.I wonder if you have any ideas to help me to solve this problem. Thank you.Best regards,Gabriel (student animal
breeding)
