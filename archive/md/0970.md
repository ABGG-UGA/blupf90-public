Something like this:

EFFECT
1 cross alpha Â  Â # fixed effect
EFFECT
2 cross alpha Â  Â # random effect
RANDOM
diagonal
(CO)VARIANCES
1.0
EFFECT
3 croos alpha Â  Â # random animal genetic effect
RANDOM
animal
OPTIONAL
pe Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â	Â  Â  Â  # random PE effect
(CO)VARIANCES
1.0
(CO)VARIANCES_PE
1.0



You can see effects without "RANDOM ...." are fixed.
