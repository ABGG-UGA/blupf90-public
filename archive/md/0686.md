Huimin,
Extreme samples could come especially in the beginning of the sampling, depending on the model. The values you showed were from the first several rounds. So at this point, I can't decide if the estimates are nonsense or the parameter file is wrong. If you find extreme values after burn-in, there would be a problem.
