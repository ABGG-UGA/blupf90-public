Hello all!!!

 Does anybody know whether it is possible to declare in fortran a variable as an integer of precision 1 bit?. 

 I want to save in this variable either 0 or 1. 

 Have been checking in google and we can define INTEGER *1 which means 1 byte (8 bits), but did not see anything
regarding 1 bit variables.

 Thank you for your comments
 Juan Pablo
