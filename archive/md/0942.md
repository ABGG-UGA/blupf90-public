The "final_solutions" file is created by thrgibbs1f90 (not by postgibbsf90). So, the solution means are calculated
using all samples with burn-in=0 in your case. I don't recommend to use this option unless you know the burn-in. Once
variance components were estimated, you can run the program with "OPTION fixed_var" to get posterior means and SDs for
solutions.

In the solution file, level numbers for the animal effect are corresponding to (renumbered) IDs in data and pedigree
files.
