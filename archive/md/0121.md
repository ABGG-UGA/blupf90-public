Hi everyone,

 I was trying to fit a three trait repeatability model in BLUPF90, but I
 don't quite understand how to set up the parameter file correctly. I was
 looking at some of the example in the wiki page, but I am not sure on
 how to do it. I have three traits con columns 4 5 6, and I have three
 effects, random animal effect on column 1 and two fixed effects on
 columns 2 and 3. The number of observations (repeated measures) for each
 animal varies between 2 and 6, and some animals just have one
 observation (is that going to be a problem?). Also I have a pedigree
 with 2025 individuals. So far this is what I was doing, but it's not
 working. I would appreciate any help or hint.

 Regards,

 Napo V.
