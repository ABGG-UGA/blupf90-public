 Just put all animals together in genotypes and pedigree but do not put phenotypes of the candidates. If your
candidates are progeny tested, use a reduced data set with no daughters of the selection candidates.

   I want to do genomic selection using preGSf90. I have already used blupf90 for doing GWAS. I have a question now
about doing genomic selection with BLUPf90. For doing genomic selection, I have ~700 training population and ~300
selection candidates. I wonder for doing ssGBLUP where the training animals should be? Should it be added to the
genotype file where the selection candidates are?
