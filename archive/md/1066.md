Dear all,
In order to better understand how postGSf90 compute markers effects and weights for weighted ssGBLUP, I tried to
reproduce the results of this software using the data simulated by Wang et al. (2012) available online with the courses
of Misztal et al (http://nce.ads.uga.edu/wiki/lib/exe/fetch.php?media=lab_gwas.zip).I used (R) to apply the algorithm
described in Wang et al. (2012). The script is in the attachment of this post. This R script is heavily commented so
that one can easily understand what is been done.When I compare the results of postGSf90 (a single iteration) with
results of simply following the algorithm of Wang et al., in R I get the following for the markers effects
				       Min.	 1st Qu.	 Median 		 Mean		    3rd Qu.    
	 Max.snp_effects_f90 -0.07477885 -0.005413091 -0.00013302035 -0.00002384825 0.005501003 0.04065680snp_effects_R
  -0.08083815 -0.017446043 -0.00002499225 -0.00033450657 0.016929161 0.09479612
And the following for the weights,
			 Min.			      1st Qu.	    Median	 Mean  3rd Qu.	   Max.weights_f90
0.000000002327998 0.06751007 0.3122754	  1 1.020618 58.73234weights_R	 0.000000408125712 0.08370354 0.4043139    1
1.213151 15.16972
Any help would be very much appreciated.
Nabeel.
