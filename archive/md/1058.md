Dear all


I have following error related to the airemlf90 (the newest updates) when I try to run multi trait models  ( 2 to 4
trait) with 40 to 50K genotypes on individuals ranging from 3000 to 15000. 


/var/spool/slurmd/job26384223/slurm_script: line 47: 11417 Done 		   echo aireml.par
     11418 Segmentation fault	   (core dumped) | airemlf90 > outaireml.log


I am running with even more tha  50Gb memory, so this is definately not related to local memory issues. The problem is
same even with univariate models. 



Please let me know if someone has solution

Thanks,
Rama
