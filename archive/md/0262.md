Non of our programs calculate heritability and its SD. When you use 
 Gibbs sampling programs including thrgibbs1f90, first you need to 
 calculate heritability from each Gibbs sample and then calculate 
 posterior SD using those heritability samples by hand. The same 
 procedure for SD of (genetic) correlation.
