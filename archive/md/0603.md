Hi, 


I ran a random regression model for milk test-day data in AIREMLF90. I used the following options to adjust the model
for heterogeneous residual variance:


OPTION hetres_pos 2 3
OPTION hetres_pol 1.0 0.1


And the results were:


 1-th trait:   1-th coefficient =  -4.9776    
 1-th trait:   2-th coefficient = -0.32965  


My doubt is: What is the meaning of these values and how to I use them to obtain the residual variance of the lactation
curve?


I appreciate any help since now.


Best regards, 
Juliana Petrini.
