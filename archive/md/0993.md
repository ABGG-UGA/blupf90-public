I think you are saying that you have 19 repeated weights per sheep from birth to 540 days. You can have as many records
as you need. Or do you really have 19 traits? What are those traits?

Â 
Regarding your example it worked for me, the only thing that you need to do is add the extension of your data and your
pedigree files (in your case .dat).
