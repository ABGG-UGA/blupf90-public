I would add a small number to the diagonals.
 If the estimates turn out not PD, usually this means too complex model or highly correlated traits. Gibbs1f90 has
mechanisms to deal with not PD matrices.

 I wanted to restart remlf90 by plugging in the last obtained estimates (after 24h of computing) as starting values but
apparently the covar-matrix for a random effect was not pos definite.So my question was if more decimals could
alleviate the problem and if one could print those estimates with more decimals?
 Thank you
 Steven
