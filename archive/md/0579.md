  Â Dear Dr. Legarra


I have run BayesC, BayesCPi and Lasso for two traits :
1. Linear trait (number of days alive)
2. Binary trait (defined as 1 and 2). 
 


I have followed your document (SNP SOLVERS in GENOMIC SELECTION), where accuracy was compared with Predict Vs Training
as:
Correlation between: estimated breeding values (EBVsÂ  ) vs the True Breeding Value (TBV) - column 14 of the file
p1_data_V.txt . 
 Â I presume this TBV is from the simulated data. 



I dont have TBV to compare, so should I estimate correlation as EBV vs Actual Phenotype?. 



Accuracy of cross validation should be correlation between Predicted phenotype (file predictions ) vs actual phenotype?


 Yes, this is what we usually do, it is done in several papers


Any other suggestion to estimate accuracy especially for binary trait?




 Not really. 

 Andres
