Dear All,
I'm running some EBV estimation using blupf90 (3 traits repeatibility model, milk-fat-prot aprox 18k data & 26k animals in the pedigree).
I'm comparing results with and without parent groups. In both cases I'm using OPTION sol se.
I have observed a 2-fold increase in Standard error when I use parent groups.
I think I'm missing something,
Best
Stefano
