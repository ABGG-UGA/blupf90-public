BÃ¡rbara,

1. AIREMLF90 (and other BLUPF90 family programs) supports multiple regressions but all the independent variables
(covariates) should be prepared by a user and stored in the data file before the analysis. In this case, you should
prepare x and x^2 in the data file. You can see p.63 of the "Manual for BLUPF90 family of programs" to fit multiple
regression coefficients. In this example, the 2nd and the 3rd effects are (fixed) regressions.

2. AIREMLF90 estimates variance components but doesn't calculate heritabilities. The heritability estimates should be
calculated from the variances by hand.
