The two files should be equivalent as they only differ in the order of effects. 
 I would check whether the program can see the correct degrees of freedom. Otherwise a case for a small example.

 Hi allI am fitting a social interaction model with two different parameter files, but I believe that both should be
equivalent.1.	    FIRST PARAMETER FILE:# BLUPF90 parameter file created by RENF90DATAFILEdNUMBER_OF_TRAITS

implementation (the one indicated in the blupf90 manual) I got this plot for the variance components when using
gibbs1f90 (I have just downloaded the binary from the wiki). What it is happening is that in a given iteration the
residual variance became zero, then it is indicated that it is not positive definitive and them it is corrected.With
the second implementation things seems to be OK. When I do the same two implementations using AIREMLf90 both systems of
equations seems to be the same.These are  the MME information for the first parameter file:  rank=	 78508 YAMS:

It seems that there is something wrong in the creation of the MME in the gibbs1f90 program. Any comment is more than
welcome.Best RegardsJuan Pablo	  Juan Pablo Sánchez SerranoGenÃ©tica y Mejora AnimalIRTATorre Marimón, 08140, Caldes
