Andreas,

BLUPf90 family can account for inbreeding. Please, download the latest version of renumf90 and try this:


Run renumf90 including the following keyword and option right before setting (CO)VARIANCES for the animal effect:

INBREEDING
pedigree




After that, just run blupf90 to calculate EBV
