Dear Andres,

 I was only giving an example about how good a sample can represent a whole population. Unfortunatly, I just used sample size as a reference. But I sure believe it is possible to have a better sample from 1000 well chosen animals than from 2000 random animals. Like you said, sample size is not everything and I totally agree with that.

 Â 

 Now, about my pedigree, it has 13 generations and, recently (2011), we used genomics to verify genealogy erros, based on 2000 genotyped animals. We observed less than 1% of errors. So, I believe my pedigree is not that bad to cause a so low correlation. In fact, 1% is an utopic value for brazilian dairy or beef populations.

 Â 

 Your example with 1 generation is perfect, and inbreeding will definetly not show up, but I think it is not the case with the pedigree in discussion, with 13 generations.

 Â 

 My best regards,
