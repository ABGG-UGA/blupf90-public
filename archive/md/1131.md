Good day,I am trying to get EBV's using Thrgibbs1f90 and I would like to believe that the EBV's are generated into the
binary_final solutions file however I cannot view its contents due to it not being a text file how do I convert it into
a text file?How does one run the binsol_to_textsol.f90 in the linux environment?Thank you.Kind regards,Deligth
