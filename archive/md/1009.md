Dear All,
After having the variance components with THRGIBBS1F90, I then put them back to the parameter file and added FIXED_VAR
mean to estimate the breeding value. Then, I ran THRGIBBS1F90 for 10,000 iterations and 1,000 for burn-in. However, the
solutions I had for EBVs varied a lot when I chose to store all sample or every 10th samples or every 20th samples.
Could you please suggest what is the best way to have the accurate EBVs? (store all or 10th or else?
Many thanks for your attention and help,
Best regards,Tuan Nguyen
