Good day Admin,
 I am still new with the BlupF90 and also in the group. I have a worrying issue with the Blup which I just installed. Every time I press the Enter key, the interface automatically quits and exits.. 
 Any idea or help to stop this will be appreciated as soon as possible please.
 Thank you
