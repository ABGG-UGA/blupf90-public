Dear all,


I´m fitting a multiple trait model with seven categorical traits.
I would like to analyze this model using the program Thrgibbs1f90.
In my data I have five traits with six categories and two traits with four categories.
I would like to set the theresholds for each traits. 


My problem is, traits with 6 categories i can set the theresholds, but traits with 4 categories i can´t.
So my question is: Can I set differents thereshold for each trait? and how can I do this?


Could you help me, please?


Thank you!
