The "final_solutions" file contains posterior means and SD of all solutions including EBV when we use "OPTION fixed_var
...". The "binary_final_solutions" file can be used to read the last Gibbs sample when we restart the program. So,
usually we are not interested in only one last Gibbs sample. And to read exact last solutions for restarting from the
last sample, it is created as a binary file.
