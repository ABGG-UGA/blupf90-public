Hi all,
We have received several reports from users about segmentation fault or sudden stop caused by our programs. If you hit
this issue, please try "ulimit" and "OMP_NUM_THREADS" methods explained in the following article.

The system limits the memory usage for a program. It means, even if you have a lot of physical memory in your system,
you may use only a portion of it. In the end, the program fails because of running out of assigned memory. The above
article explains how you can increase the memory that a program can use.
