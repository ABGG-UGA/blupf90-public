Dear all,

I am trying to practice using THRGIBBS1F90. I use one example from http://nce.ads.uga.edu. But I can not finish it and
I really need your help.
The data file has 4 columns as

 41 39 0.172912 2 60 2 -3.21954 1 54 41 0.305374 2 . .
 .
 .
 .
 .
 .
 .

  and the parameter file is
DATAFILE
data.thr
NUMBER_OF_TRAITS
1
NUMBER_OF_EFFECTS
2
OBSERVATION(S)
4
WEIGHT(S)

EFFECTS: POSITIONS_IN_DATAFILE NUMBER_OF_LEVELS TYPE_OF_EFFECT	[EFFECT NESTED]
1 100 cross
2  50 cross
RANDOM_RESIDUAL VALUES
1
RANDOM_GROUP
2
RANDOM_TYPE
diagonal
FILE

(CO)VARIANCES
0.01
OPTION cat 2
#First, I run the thrgibbs1f90.exe file. then I continue to run postgibbs1f90.exe#So, I have the result in postout file
as
			   ********   Monte Carlo Error by Time Series	 ********
  Pos. eff1 eff2 trt1 trt2	  MCE	     Mean			  HPD				     ......
										  Interval		  (95%)   
    1	 2    2    1	1      0.13968E-03   0.13294E-01       0.66840E-02	  0.21060E-01 ......   
    2	 0    0    1	1      0.44446E-03   1.0054		   0.98070		1.0330	       ........
#But I do not understand why there are differences between Pos. "1" and "2". 
Why the eff1 and eff2 in the first row have the value of 2 while in the 2nd row they are 0?
On the other hand, when I run the postgibbs1f90.exe, I also want to have a plot. but I receive a message as :
 'gnuplot' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file. 
So, what should I do if I want to have the graph of sample or the histogram.
Thank you very much for your help.
