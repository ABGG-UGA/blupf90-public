```
1 2 # Following the instruction in the manual file, I put 1 and 2 , but I have no idea why we put it here. what do 1
and 2 mean in here?

In this example, you can seePos.
1
2


The position means "Pos." in postout. So, 1 and 2 mean numbers 1 and 2 (Pos.) in postout, corresponding to effect 2 and
residual variances.Â 


On the other case:
Â " Choose a graph for samples (= 1) or histogram (= 2); or exit (= 0)"

Â 2 # I chose 2 for the histogram

Â TypeÂ Â Â  positionÂ Â Â  andÂ Â Â  #Â Â Â  bins

1 20 # I also do not understand why we have 1 and 20 in here.


Here again, the position means the number for "Pos." in postout. So, you can choose 1 or 2 for position and any numbers
(10, 20, 30, ...) for # bins.
