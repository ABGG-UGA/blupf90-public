Dear all,Could any one please explain me what exactly the meaning of the Thrgibbs1f90 message (number of samples and
length of burn-in)  is?Does the "number of samples" mean the total number of records in the data file??What is the
"burn-in"?I have a data file containing 3575124 records for 959501 animals for the trait  non-return rate at 56 days
(NR56) with 6 effects.	what is - in your opinion- the best number of samples and length of burn-in  in this case?
Thanks in advance;
Here is my parameter file:## Parameter file for renumf90 ## DATAFILEdata.datTRAITS 7FIELDS_PASSED TO OUTPUT WEIGHT(S)
