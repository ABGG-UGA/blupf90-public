Hi Bill  


It seems that you may have some format issues in your data file

Here some suggestions


Check outputs from airemlf90 and remlf90 in particular how many records were read and check number of rows in your file


you can use wc command to inspect your file:


wc -l  goblalr 


Also check "Data record length =" 


Number of columns for each row. 


With the following command you expect only on line with the number of columns of your file.


 awk '{ print NF }' globalr | sort -u 


Also grep your file for NaN or Inf strings 


Gibbs1 and gibbs2 proceed in different way to read data and then this is why 2 different errors. 


Missing traits are supported  in gibbs programs but each record needs to have at least one non-missing trait.

I have a simple model with 4 effects (2 random including diagonal and add_animal) and 16 traits. 

The same parameter file, data file, pedigree file work with REMLF90 and AIREMLF90 and I want to compare to GIBBS, but
using the same parameter files etc with GIBBS restuls in an error, although differen for each GIBBS program 

For GIBBS2 I get forrtl severe list-directed I/O syntax error, unit 50 file ...globalr, which is my data file 

GIBB1 complains

 All traits are missing; eliminate such records!
Any ideas?  I assumed that if it works with REMLF90 and AIREMLF90 that the data and parameter files are OK
