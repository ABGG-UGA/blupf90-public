Blupf90 constructs mixed model equations in memory. Memory requirements increase quadratically with the number of
traits. 
 So reduce the number of traits.

Â Dear All,Not sure if anybody has already asked theÂ similar question. I am having an issue with " too many elements

with 15 traits, which also includes a 50k SNP genotype dataset consistingÂ almost 5000 animals. So, this is a fairly
computationally expensive model.Â Probably that's whyÂ when we reach at a pointÂ the program execution ceases with the
log message below:#--------------------------Program log#--------------------------Â CONVERT_HASH_IJA_GENERAL: too many
elements found in a hash matrix
 Â The upper limit & actual number of elementsÂ  2147483647Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  2798024996
 #---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We are running this in a redhat linux server with a fairly large amount of memory (96-100 GB). Does anybody know if it
is possible toÂ perform a runtime memory allocation?Â Is thereÂ any otherÂ tricks to run a large model with blupf90
programs?
I am kinda stuck here, because I didn't find anything regarding this in the manual or online.I'd appreciate ifÂ someone
could help me out somehow.
Thanks a lot.
