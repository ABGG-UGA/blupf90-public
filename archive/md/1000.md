Dear Shogo,
I ran the 3-parity random regression model and got the rr coefficients. for instance, with order 3 LP model, the
coeffcient matrix is a 9x9 matrix. 
My question is: 
1. from the 9x9 matrix below (obtainied using order 3 for 3 parities), which coeffcients corespond to variances and
covariances within and between parities?

2. How to estimate variance covariances using the 9x9 coeffcient matrix, since the polynomials are in my case 235 x 3 (
for order 3) i.e. dim are from 2 to day 236.
