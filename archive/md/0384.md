Yes, the residual is the last parameter. For 2 trait repeatability 
 model, the order in the AI matrix will be
 G # Additive
 1 2
 3
 G # PE
 4 5
 6
 R
 7 8
 9

 You can calculate se for heritability by hand (see the PDF file for 
 standard error from http://nce.ads.uga.edu/wiki/doku.php?id=faq), but 
 the easiest way is to use the following option:

 OPTION se_covar_function H2_1 G_2_2_1_1/(G_2_2_1_1+G_3_3_1_1+R_1_1)
 OPTION se_covar_function H2_2 G_2_2_2_2/(G_2_2_2_2+G_3_3_2_2+R_2_2)
