Huimin,
Your parameter file seems to be correct. So the possible reasons for this issue are 1) wrong specification of the model
(wrong position of columns etc.) and/or 2) too complicated model. The latter reason is more plausible. This is an issue
in modeling rather than in BLUPF90 programs. Simplifying the model can be a solution to this problem.

Let's consider this analysis. This is a 9-trait model with 5th order polynomials for the additive genetic effect
(G:45x45), 4th order polynomials for the permanent environmental effect (P:36x36), and 10 residual covariance matrices
(R:10x9x9). The number of (co)variance components to be estimated is 1035 [45*46/2 + 36*37/2 + 6*3*10] and this is way
too large to obtain stable estimates. Gibbs sampling is not perfect - it could fail. Usually, higher order of random
regression coefficients don't account for the variation so the covariances among the coefficients are just nuisance.
The data wouldn't provide enough information to estimate such covariances. 

A practical way to determine the complete covariance matrix for 9-trait could be: 1) Perform single-trait
multiple-parity analysis for each trait. Cut the higher-order random-regression coefficients as many as possible, 2)
Perform 2-trait analysis several times, and 3) Combine the results from the analyses.
