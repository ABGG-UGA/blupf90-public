Dear All,
I'm new user of BLUPf90;
I want to fit a two-trait model (with gibbsf90), where just one has repeated measures. I followed the instructions of Andres Legarra of a previous post; so my data file has the following form:
animaltrait1trait2effec1_trait2effect1_trait1effect2_trait1permanent_trait1cov1_trait1cov2_trait11-999119.549-999
-999
1-999-9991308-999-99921126.43698.721328-999-999
32138.531484.821333-999-999
43150.702570.491308-999-999
53162.673927.11
*trait1 has repeated measures.*missing code is -999
I have several questions:

a) Is this data structure correct?b) Is it correct to put the effects for the trait1 as missing on each first line?c) In case there are missing an observation for trait2, for example:animaltrait1trait2effec1_trait2effect1_trait1effect2_trait1permanent_trait1cov1_trai1cov2_trait13-999-9998-999
-999
3-999-9993278-999-99921322.34499.083400-999-999
32335.461257.413433-999-999
43351.782681.173429-999-999
53360.323638.50
What do you recommend me to do? Since I would have a line with both missing observations.

Thank you in advance.
regards
Alan
