The inflation is not observed in GBLUP. 

There are about 1500 phenotypes for the indicator trait, and 7000 for the actual carcass trait. The correlation between
EBV for the two traits in GBLUP when separated (two single-trait runs) is 0.29. When they are combined in a two-trait
single-step run that correlation goes to 0.96. As you mentioned, it looks like the carcass trait is overwhelming the
indicator trait.   


Thanks for the response.
