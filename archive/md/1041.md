Hi Maria,
There are some possibilities: 



1. AI-REML may not get converged and the estimates are wrong or nonsense. Please make sure the convergence occurred.

2. A high correlation between random-regression coefficients (intercept and slope in this case) may be caused with a
high correlation between covariates (column 2 and 3 in this case).
3. Several components may be confounded. For example, if an animal has only few records, the animal effect might be
confounded with PE and the variance components likely biased. Also, the data structure could contribute to the results.
