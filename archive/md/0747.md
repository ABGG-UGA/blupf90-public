Dear,


I have an error with the latest version of renumf90 (1.114) that I don't have with version 1.111 :


$ renumf90Â 
Â RENUMF90 version 1.114
Â name of parameter file?renum_aireml.par
Â renum_aireml.par
Â n_comb Â  Â  Â  Â  Â	1
Â ERROR in a "COMBINE" block



I have these two lines on the top of the parameter file :Â 
COMBINE 15 8 12
COMBINE 16 11 12


The problem seems to come from these lines but I don't understand because it works with the previous version.


Thanks in advance
Regards,
Julie
