Hi everyone,
 I was trying to run a two traits aniaml model in Gibbs190, but I don't quite understand how to set up the parameter file correctly. I was looking at some of the example in the wiki page, but I am not sure on how to do it because unfortunately there are not pedigree and data file for the 7th example in example page at wiki (http://nce.ads.uga.edu/wiki/doku.php?id=faq.example ).In fact I have problem with effects part in parameter file. Could you help me in parameter file for this short example?
 Data file(data):
 Animal HYS Y1 Y2
 11 1 10 20
 12 3 12 22
 13 2 13 25
 14 3 11 23
 15 3 10 20
 16 2 10 23
 17 3 13 21
 18 2 11 22
 19 1 14 24
 20 1 10 25

 Pedigree file(ped):
 animal sire dam
 11 1 4
 12 1 5
 13 1 5
 14 2 6
 15 2 6
 16 2 6
 17 3 4
 18 3 4
 19 3 5
 20 3 5
