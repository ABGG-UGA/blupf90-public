Dear Shogo,

I have tried postgibbsf90 but I still have the problem.


Read  50000 samples from round 10 to 500000
Burn-in?
250000	  # I chose to burn-in 250000
Give n to read every n-th sample?
50    # I wanted to read every 50 samples

Every n-th stored in gibbs_samples		10
# samples after burn-in =	    25000
# samples after burn-in used =		   5000


And the interval of the used samples is still 50,000 to 300,000.
I also noticed that if I put 1 or 100 as a value for n in " Give n to read every n-th sample?" the program will stop
working.


For more information, I am trying to use THRGIBBS1F90 to analysis one binary trait with both direct genetic effect and
maternal genetic effect.
 
Thank you very much.
Tuan Nguyen
