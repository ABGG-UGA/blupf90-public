Julien,

Your model looks simpler than what I expected. I still need some more information to suggest the parameter file. I
guess:

- You have 7 traits and try to run 7-trait analysis.
- The animal genetic effect (with pedigree) is assumed for all the 7 traits.
- The dam environmental effect (no pedigree) is assumed only for the first 2 traits.

Above statements are correct?
