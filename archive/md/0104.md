Not sure this is possible with renumf90 directly. Shogo Tsuruta or Ignacio Aguilar may know more.

 One solution is to use renumf90 for a regular animal model , passing covariables for random regression to the output. Then add random regressions in ref90.par. Effect positions for the effect with no random regressions are 0.

 Hello all,

 I would like to do a bivariate analysis using gibbs1f90, but first I want to use renumf90.

 I don´t know how to do the parameter file, because my first trait is fitted by random regression with two random effects: animal and permanent environment. 
 The second trait don´t use random regression and have only one random effect (animal).

 Could you please help me?
