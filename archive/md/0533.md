Dear Shogo, Thanh you very much for your update. The updated program works well with 50 for n to read every n-th
sample.However, I also find that it can not work when I choose 100.For the same result from thrgibbs1f90 analysisI have
the warning:


Read  50000 samples from round 10 to 500000
Burn-in?
250000	  # I chose to burn-in 250000
Give n to read every n-th sample?
100    # I wanted to read every 100 samples

Every n-th stored in gibbs_samples		10
# samples after burn-in =	    25000
# samples after burn-in used =		   2500
forrtl: severe (157) : Program Exception - access violation


What should I do to have an analysis from every 100-th sample?


Thank You very much.
Tuan
