Thank you so much for your help Dr. Tsuruta!
If it's not too much to ask, we have a few more questions:
Does THRGIBBS1F90 sets the first two thresholds, respectively, to zero and one by default? Because in our case, working
with 6 scores the program has released 3 thresholds in the gibbs_samples file... Are they the 3rd, 4th and 5th?
Are these thresholds (obtained from gibbs_samples file) needed to transfer from the underlying liability scale to the
probability scale?  
How to proceed to obtain the point on the underlying liability scale to calculate the probability of an animal's
progeny achieve the last class (EBV of score 6)? Does the pnorm function of R software could be used to obtain the
probability?


In advance grateful!
Best regards,
Daniel.
