Hi,
I was wondering how do we get the estimate of fixed effects from thrgibbs1f90b if we are re-running the software. 
 I know that the estimates of all effects are stored in the file final_solutions if you use "OPTION solution mean". However, if you want to re-run the program using "OPTION cont ..." then you are not allowed to use "OPTION solution mean". You get a message:  ??? cannot specify both cont and solutions or fixed_var at the same time  No "OPTION solution mean" means no final_soltuion file, and no estimate of fixed effects! I guess the estimates are written in the file "last_soltuion" but this is a binary file and the user cannot read it.

 I appreciate your helpBehrang
