Hi All,

Using thrgibbs1F90, I fitted a Sire-Maternal Grandsire model to estimate sire variance component and residual variance
for calving ease. The converged estimates were (S = 0.39, R=3.99). I was expecting that the residual variance would be
around an estimate of (1). am I missing something?
if these estimates were OK, is there any way to scale them back (Resid. var = 1)?


Thanks,
```
