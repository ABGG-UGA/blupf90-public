Hi, 


this question is not exactly about BLUPF90 programs, but I will appreciate any help. I have records of productive life
(PL) of a Holstein population, measured as the number of days in production since the cow's first calving. There is a
record of productive life for each test-day of the cow. So, the same cow has several records of PL in each lactation. 


I want some suggestions about the most adequate model and methodology to estimate genetic parameters and breeding
values for this trait. I tried random regression analysis; however, the model did not converge (probably due some
confounding effect between days in milk and PL). 


Since now, I thank any suggestion. 


Best regards, 
Juliana Petrini.
