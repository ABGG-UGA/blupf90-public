Dear
I am running a 5-trait model with approximately 7000 observations and about 600 genotyped animals. At the moment, I put
convergence at 1d-9.Running this model with 2 random 'animal' traits (sire-dam model) works nicely.However, when I add
a third random 'diagonal' effect iterations stop at round 231 at convergence 8.169079290115900E-009.I repeated this
several times, and every time the program stopped at round 231.
Do you have any ideas what may trigger this problem and how it can be solved?
Thanks in advance!
Kind regards
