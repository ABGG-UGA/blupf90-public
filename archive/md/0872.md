Dear All,Not sure if anybody has already asked the similar question. I am having an issue with " too many elements found in a hash matrix" problem while running the "blupf90" fortran module. We are running a multi-trait genomic model with 15 traits, which also includes a 50k SNP genotype dataset consisting almost 5000 animals. So, this is a fairly computationally expensive model. Probably that's why when we reach at a point the program execution ceases with the log message below:#--------------------------Program log#-------------------------- CONVERT_HASH_IJA_GENERAL: too many elements found in a hash matrix
 The upper limit & actual number of elements  2147483647            2798024996
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We are running this in a redhat linux server with a fairly large amount of memory (96-100 GB). Does anybody know if it is possible to perform a runtime memory allocation? Is there any other tricks to run a large model with blupf90 programs?
I am kinda stuck here, because I didn't find anything regarding this in the manual or online.I'd appreciate if someone could help me out somehow.
Thanks a lot.
