Dear All, 
I'm new in blupf90 discussion group. Please pardon me if I'm asking a repetitive question.
I'm trying to run BLUPf90 program with a large dairy cattle dataset including about 20,000,000 records and about
1,500,000 animals using single-trait random regression. Unfortunately, I'm getting the following error in
Linux."SIGSEGV, SEGMENTATION FAULT OCCURRED." 
and in windows OS usually the BLUPf90 program closes after some calculations with this error (BLUPf90.exe has stopped
working). log file is attached.
It would be appreciated if you could give me more help on this issue.
