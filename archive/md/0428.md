To add more information to the discussion, the pedigree had 13 generations (85000 animals) and it came from a line from
a swine breeding program. Lowest inbreeding coefficient (considering 1000 genotyped animals only) was 1.02 and highest
was 1.37. So, I do not believe this pedigree was the reason for that really low inbreeding correlation. Also, running
ROH for the same group of animals, inbreeding correlation between ROH and G diagonal was 0.24 only. 

So, my theory is that, maybe, my sample (1000 genotyped animals) was not enough to estimate real inbreeding. I know
that when using a pedigree, to estimate inbreeding coefficients, we miss a lot of information from mendelian sampling,
but will genomic information be always better? Even with 500, 700, or a 1000 genotyped animals?


Also, how precise is G matrix with only a 1000 animals? Or ROH?


Now, about my comments on my last message, by running a simulation, I observed that it is possible to have a low
correlation like that, even with higher correlation with diagonal and off-diagonal terms together. So, numerically,
this situation is feasible.
