```
I am using the new version of PostgsF90 (linux 64 bit), no error message appears while running the program, but my
outputs (chrsnp; chrsnp_pval; chrsnpvar; snp_sol; windows_segments; windows_variance) are blank. This is the message
that the program releases:
*--------------------------------------------------** Setup Genomic Done !!!, elapsed time:	 4.032
**--------------------------------------------------*
 Type of IJA from file and current IJA storage: IJA4 IJA8 Convert storage to IJA8

Solutions read from file: "solutions"Segmentation fault (core dumped)
However, before the upgrade the program worked normally. Please, any idea what happened?

Thanks.
