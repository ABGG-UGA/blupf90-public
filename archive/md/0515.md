Thank Andres very much.

I also have another question.
When I want to run a model which has both additive effect and maternal effect.
How can I create a parameter file:
should I put both of them together in the RANDOM_GROUP as

RANDOM_GROUP
2 3                     # 2 and 3 are animal and dam id respectively
RANDOM_TYPE
add_animal
FILE
renadd02.ped
(CO)VARIANCES
   1.0000      0.10000    
  0.10000       1.0000

OR can I put them separately as:

RANDOM_GROUP
2                  #animal id
RANDOM_TYPE
add_animal
FILE
renadd02.ped
(CO)VARIANCES
1
RANDOM_GROUP
3                     # dam id
RANDOM_TYPE
add_animal
FILE
renadd02.ped
(CO)VARIANCES
1

SHOULD I use add_animal or add_an_upg in RANDOM_TYPE?

Thanks.
