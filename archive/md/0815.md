```
I install the last version of BlupF90 on a Unix platform.When I try to rerun some of my old files, for some reason it can not find the data and pedigree files ( Pedigree file is not found. file=FILE).
Is there a change on the syntaxis for the parameter input file to run renumf90???
ThanksGonzalo
