As you see the message "insufficient virtual memory", your computer doesn't have enough memory to run renumf90 for this
model. But it usually doesn't happen unless you are trying to create extremely a huge model. So, it is likelyÂ there
are some mistakes in your parameter file for renumf90. If possible, show me the parameter file for renumf90 and tell me
how large your model is going to be.
