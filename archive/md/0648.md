I hereby wish request your help in a doubt i have.


I'm working with four categorical traits, i will analyze multi traits model.


The values of  residual (co) variances	may be set at a number other than 1 ?
Or need to be set at 1 in the calculations to threshold model (multi trait) ? 



I can calculate the values of the residual (co) variance (threshold model multi trait) in THRGIBBS1F90 ?


Thank you very much. 
Best regards, Ricardo. (Sorry, for my English)
