Hi,  I’m new to AIREMLF90 and want to clarify my understanding of how to evaluate significance of the heritability
estimated from genetic variance in this software. Apologies if this question has been addressed already, my searches
didn't turn up any answers.  For this example, I’ve analyzed a single trait in offspring from a diallel cross.
Relevant details of the model are here:EFFECTS: POSITIONS_IN_DATAFILE NUMBER_OF_LEVELS TYPE_OF_EFFECT[EFFECT NESTED]  2
      184 crossRANDOM_TYPE add_animal  then I estimated heritability as:OPTION se_covar_function H2
G_1_1_1_1/(G_1_1_1_1+R_1_1)So far so good, the heritability estimates are similar to estimates from other software and
this function matches the direct calculation (genetic variance/total variance) from the output.  Now the question:  How
should we evaluate whether the estimated heritability is significantly different from zero? It would be ideal to
calculate a p-value but 95% confidence intervals would be sufficient. Can 95% confidence intervals be calculated from
the reported “Sample SD”?	Can anyone point me toward a resource that addresses this? Thanks for any advice,  -Eli
