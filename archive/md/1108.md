Hello!I recently started tinkering with Blupf90. I am particularly interested in ssGWAS, as I will be performing genome
wide association studies as part of my PhD project. Following the tutorial found on
http://nce.ads.uga.edu/wiki/lib/exe/fetch.php?media=tutorial_blupf90.pdf
 I was able to piece together the necessary steps. However I am a little bit confused with the results. I have attached
some files to illustrate the problems I’m having. Please bear in mind that I am new to this software and I only
recently started working with it (and “learned” on my own). 
I started off by creating a parameter file using renumf90, and modified the renf90.par file in order to run it with
preGSf90, blupf90 and postGSf90 (attached). I performed quality control with preGSf90 and I included the option OPTION
snp_p_value (where appropriate) in order to get the p-values for the Manhattan plot (attached). I plotted it using the
R package qqman. This is where things get strange. I have also included the Manhattan plot, which does not look
particularly good. I noticed that my solutions for the p-values contain p-values above 1, which I also found to be very
strange. Upon further inspection, I noticed that are also some issues with the QQ-plot where the p-values seem to be
inflated. I am a bit lost in regards to these results. No matter what trait I analyse, I encounter the same issues,
whether I use a simple or more complex model or not. The Manhattan plots display always the same problems and the
QQ-plot always follows a similar curve. 
If someone can have a look at these files and let me know what/if am I doing wrong, it would be greatly appreciated. I
understand that my explanation of my issues might not be the best, so please let me know if you need
clarification.Thank you very much for your attention and time! Looking forward to your feedback.
