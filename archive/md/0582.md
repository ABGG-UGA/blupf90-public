Dear BLUPf90 team,
I have tried to run an analysis (single-step BLUP) with 10 traits in BLUPf90.I have 4461 genotyped animals, 35525 animals in the pedigree, and 6716 records in the phenotype file.Each trait is modelled with the same animal model with 4 fixed effects and random animal effect.Everything works fine if I run the analysis with the first 5 traits or the last 5 traits.I can also run it with 9 traits, but it crashes when I have all 10 traits (see LOG1).I am running this on a 64bit Windows server with 256 GB of RAM.As far as I could see BLUPf90 (version 1.48) used around 78 GB or RAM.Recently I tried running this analysis with an updated version of BLUPf90 (version 1.51).In this case it runs, but I get NaN as solutions for convergence values and as solutions for all animals (see LOG2).I would like to add that this analysis worked fine in the past when I had a smaller dataset with only 2500 genotyped animals, 5000 phenotyped animals, and around 32000 animals in the pedigree.I will be grateful for your help and suggestions.
