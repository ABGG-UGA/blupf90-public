Napo, either way should work.
Number of levels should match your data, which is assumed recoded sequentially from  1 to the maximum number.

  Thanks Marek,

 The levels of the factor which I was referring to are 1,2,4, and 7
 (corresponding to 4 categories), plus missing obs, and for level 7 there
 are only 4 animals in it. Should I recode them to 1,2,3 and 4 or put
 instead that the factor has 7 levels?
