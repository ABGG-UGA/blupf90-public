Hi,
I have question about the log file from AIREMLF90, namely:


My inverse of AI matrix (Sampling Variance) looks like sparse matrix, is it correct?

I never had inverser of AI matrix like this:


inverse of AI matrix (Sampling Variance)
   0.74569E-08	  0.0000	    0.0000	       0.0000		   0.0000    
   0.0000	     0.23669E-10    -0.11985E-10    0.0000		0.0000	  
   0.0000	     -0.11985E-10    0.94343E-11     0.0000		 0.0000    
   0.0000	     0.0000		0.0000		   0.0000	       0.0000	 
   0.0000	     0.0000		0.0000		   0.0000	       0.84758E-08



 all time I had full matrix (without 0) and I am not sure that it's ok.

I had two similar animal models and in one of them i have "normal" results and in the second 

i have matrix as above.


Could someone tell me more about the inverse of AI matrix? 




Thank you in advance.

Regards,
Lupo.
