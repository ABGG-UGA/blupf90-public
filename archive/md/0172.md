Dear all,

 I'm trying to fit a model that include maternal and maternal permanent enviroment effects to predict their genetic
value using Blupf90. How can I do to include differents maternal variance and maternal permanent enviroment variance
when I work with different breeds for fosters dam? I already have that's variances.


 With regards,
 Vin√≠cius Junqueira
