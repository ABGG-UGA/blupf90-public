Hi Lukas,
I have sent an email to you for details so, here, my response is for users who have the same equation.


The blupf90 programs do not have an option to calculate deregressed proof (or DYD). We do have some tools to compute
such values. Currently, it is not in public and it is available with an agreement with our team.
