Hi, 
I want to estimate the standard error for the heritability by using the information from airemlf90.log. I'm using an animal model with permanent environmental effect. This way, I want to know if the order of sampling variances and covariances in the inverse AI matrix is the same of the parameters in the output (additive genetic variance, permanent environmental variance, residual variance). Moreover, I want to know if there is a R package or script that estimates this standard error from airemlf90.log.  Below, I included an example of the output file: 


 AI-REMLF90 ver. 1.101
 In round        103 convergence =  0.866819310938E-08
 delta convergence =  0.448681266465E-05
-2logL =        51904.866     : AIC =        51910.866    
Genetic variance(s) for effect  6       
  0.95857E-01
Genetic variance(s) for effect  7       
  0.37793E-01
Residual variance(s)
  0.38138    
inverse of AI matrix (Sampling Variance)
  0.12197E-03 -0.80774E-04 -0.32669E-07
 -0.80774E-04  0.69967E-04 -0.23510E-05
 -0.32669E-07 -0.23510E-05  0.14395E-04
Correlations from inverse of AI matrix

 -0.87437       1.0000     -0.74082E-01
 -0.77967E-03 -0.74082E-01   1.0000
SE for R
  0.37940E-02
SE for G
  0.11044E-01
SE for G
  0.83646E-02


Since now, I thank you for the attention. 


Best regards, 
Juliana.
