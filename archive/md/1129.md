```
Is it possible to establish a prior value for the scale parameter in the inverted chi-squared distribution, used as the
prior distribution for variances? 
Another doubt, which prior values should I use to get a non-informative prior?
Since now, I thank for any help regarding these issues. 
Best regards,Juliana.
