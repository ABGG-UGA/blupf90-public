Dear all, 

I am reading the wiki page of preGSf90 and it says " Field 2 - genotype with 0,1,2 and 5 (missing) or real values for gene content 0.12 â€¦"
I am trying to use real values as an input genotype file, is there any option to define the delimiter of genotype file?  
Is real value input also supported in renumf90? 
Thank you!
