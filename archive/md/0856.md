How many genotyped animals do you have?

Â Dear everyone,
 I want to compare GEBV of young animals (with genotypes only) estimated by 2 methods-

 1. I obtained young animals GEBV from BLUPF90 program.
 2. I follwed the ssGBLUP method. Used POSTGSF90 for SNP effects (output file: snp_pred), 
 followed by PREDF90 for predicting DGV (Output file: SNP_preictions) for those young animals.

 According to BLUPF90 manual, DGV is indirect calculation of GEBV. So, I assume that GEBV from above two
 methods might be different. But when I compared both estimates, they seem to differ a lot.

 Example:

 OBS method1 method2
 1 26.1801 13.4311
 2 21.5684 9.1005
 3 24.9228 12.2045
 4 23.7546 11.1711
 5 8.0091 -4.6540
 6 19.3956 6.6002
 7 14.1853 1.2713
 8 13.2292 0.3604
 9 26.1617 13.1466
 10 12.6000 0.0907

 So, I wonder if this difference is normal or not? I used the same genotype file in both approach. 
 Just couldn't figure out why these estimates differ so much for the same animal.
 I would greatly appreciate if anyone kindly give me some insight into this matter.

 Thank you.
