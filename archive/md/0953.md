Hello.I'am trying to estimate breeding values  through THRGIBBS.My data have 2 binary traits.When the program runs, the
matrices that appear on screen show some columns and rows with zero but in the input file, that is no zero on those
columns or rows.The input file and a example of what happens is attach.Anyone know what could be happening?Thanks!
