Juan Pablo,


When AI-REML doesn't converge, usually I try:
1) run with "OPTION EM-REML xxx", in this case, xxx can be between 100 and 174"
2) put the estimates from EM-REML in the parameter file, run AI-REML until convergence or with "OPTION maxrounds 0".
3) run with "OPTION tol x.x", where x.x can be very small value (e.g., < 1d-12); the default is 1d-12, which is the eigenvalue to reconstruct the covariance matrix when it is non-positive definite.


EM-REML forces to converge even when there are no covariances or it is impossible to estimate (i.e., non-positive definite). Usually, I don't trust EM estimates when AI-REML doesn't converge, so I always check with other programs. If you got the estimates from EM-REML, why do you need to run AI-REML anyway?
