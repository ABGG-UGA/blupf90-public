The "last_solutions" file is one last sample of solutions from many iterations (samples). This file can be used to
restart the program from the last sampling; otherwise it (just one sample) is usually useless for users.If you need
posterior means of solutions, I suggest to run thrgibbs1f90 again (maybe around 5000-10000 rounds), putting those
estimates in the parameter file with "OPTION fixed_var mean" after you got estimates of variance components.
