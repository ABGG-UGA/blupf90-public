Andres,

I forgot to say that I had included one effect on renf90.dat that relates phenotypes with dominance effects and the
coding used for was the same for additive (thats why I used _XrefID coding - from 1 to 3455). The level 1 on dominance
effect (in renf90.dat) is the same level on line 1 and column 1 (and so on) on my input file.


Andres, thanks for reply!!

Vinicius,
you are using user_file and so the coding of the dominant effect is (or can be) different from the coding of the animal
effect and the codes in X_refid. For blupf90, user_file can be just anything and does not know that these are animals.
You must code the dominant effects from 1 to 3455 and then put those values as an extra column in the data file. The
codes can be the same as for "animal" or they can be different.

 Hi all,


I‚Äôm fitting an repeatability animal model in airemlf90 with additive and dominance random effects. I‚Äôm computing
dominance effects as ~ N(0,D*s2d), since D is being created as proposed by Vitezica et al. (2013). Dominance file
format follow as an example bellow in which first (i) and second (j) columns are recoded as animal id on
[snp_file_name]_XrefID file. Am I recoding dominance file wrong?


1 1    1.0121500492
1 2    0.0129484450
1 3    0.0083033340
1 4   -0.0017907361
1 5    0.0124599356
1 6    0.0113029769
1 7   -0.0185306780
1 8   -0.0305246934

[‚Ä¶]


All phenotyped animals (3455) are genotyped. Sire and dam informations are missing, so, the second and third columns of
my pedigree file are zero in all levels.



When starting iterative process with different initial values (tested several times) it can be noted that variance of
dominance is going to zero and there is no significant difference on deviance between iterations. Any suggestions?


An example of iteration statistics is presented below.
