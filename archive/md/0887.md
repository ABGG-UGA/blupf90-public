Ignacy,

Thanks so much for you suggestion.Â 


I did a test right now and it works well

Â Stefano,
These traits may be strongly correlated and the resulting covariance matrices may not have full rank. Especially if %
protein and fat are derived from kilos.Â 
Our REML programs do not handle not-full rank matrices but gibbs2f90 can do it. Â

Dear All,

I'm running a VCE using a multi trait animal model (5 traits).


Data are from buffalo milk production (milk kg, protein and fat kg + %)


The model includes 4 fixed effects, 1 additive and 1 permanent.


After few iterations estimate for Milk residual variance becomes negative (as well as covariance amok milk kg and
contents).


I'm trying to figure out wha's going on.Â 


Any idea?


best


Stefano


PS I'm using both AIREML and REML
