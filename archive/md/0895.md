Once you got estimates of variance components at convergence, use those estimates in your parameter file and run
thrgibbs1f90 with "OPTION fixed_var mean", maybe running 5000-10000 rounds with 10% as burn-in. You will get posterior
means and SD for all solutions.

It is because you will never know when you can get those estimates at convergence (how many rounds and many samples
should be burn-in), so you can't get accurate solutions until you get variance components.
