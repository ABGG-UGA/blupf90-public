Thanks Rocha and Andres for your reply. But letÂ´s use BLUPF90 manual as an example (pages 82, 83 and 84). Genomic and
pedigree inbreeding correlation is 0.32 (diagonal terms). Off-diagonal terms correlation is 0.66 and all terms
correlation is 0.64. So, adding diagonal terms to the full set decreased correlation, which is logical. Now,
considering my example, correlation increased by adding almost completely non-related terms, which seems weird to me. 

In terms of inbreeding and families, I agree with both of you, but numerically, I am not sure yet.


My best regards,


Marcelo Freitas
