There are several options you can try:

1. Use omega < 1.0 (OPTION TauOmega 1.0 0.9 for example). This may be the easiest way but not a very good option.
2. Including inbreeding in A. You can use renumf90 with "INBREEDING" to calculate and include inbreeding coefficients.
3. If you use unknown parent group (UPG), use "OPTION exact_upg".
4. (Co)variance matrix may be close to non-positive definite. The ill condition of the left-hand side of the MME may be
due to multicollinearity.
5. Usually the matrix G is singular, so you can try another set of alpha and beta (default: alpha=0.95 and beta=0.05).
For example, "OPTION AlphaBeta 0.9 0.1".
