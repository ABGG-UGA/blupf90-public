Hello everyone,

 I learned that BLUPF90 handles a given pedigree in way, that 1 is given 
 for the diagonal even if the respective animal is inbred. In the 
 literature, BLUP equations are also presented in the form that the 
 diagonal entries are 1+Fii (Fii inbreeding coefficient of this animal). 
 However, 1 on the diagonal seems to be preferred for practical reasons, 
 and BLUPF90 follows this.

 I'm looking for arguments for both options. My starting point is as follows:

 It is clear, from the perspective of the likelihood that a given allele 
 is transferred, 1+Fii on the diagonal is more consequential.
 From the perspective, that for BLUP the relationship matrix is actually 
 used to assert the similarity between animals, the 1 on the diagonal 
 makes sense.

 Perhaps, for most applications the difference is very small. The reason 
 I'm asking is for honeybee breeding - and for a community of workerbees 
 as an entity in BLUP, the difference is huge. I know, most of you are 
 not into honeybee breeding. What I hope for is that the arguments for 1 
 vs. 1+Fii can help me make a informed decision in my case.

 Thank you very much for your input
 Andreas Hoppe
