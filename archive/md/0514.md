Â Thank Shogo very much. It is really the big help for me.
Is it possible for me to have another question?
I am trying to run the animal model for the categorical trait " stillborn",Â 
which have the value 1: stillborn and 0: alive
I create the parameter file, which contains


Â DATAFILE
renf90.dat Â  Â  Â  # the data file Â  Â  Â  Â	Â  Â  Â 
Â NUMBER_OF_TRAITS
1 Â  Â	Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  # one trait : stillborn
Â NUMBER_OF_EFFECTS
5
Â OBSERVATION(S)
1
Â WEIGHT(S)
Â Â 
Â EFFECTS: POSITIONS_IN_DATAFILE NUMBER_OF_LEVELS TYPE_OF_EFFECT Â [EFFECT NESTED]
Â  Â  Â  2 60 cross # hys
Â  Â  Â  5 7 cross # parity
Â  Â  Â  6 2 cross # sex
Â  Â  Â  7 1 cov # total born
Â  Â  Â  8 1 cov # weightÂ 


Â RANDOM_RESIDUAL VALUES
Â 0.047924955 Â  Â  Â  Â  Â # I just use the variance of the simple variance calculation for this binary trait
RANDOM_GROUP

Â RANDOM_TYPE
Â add_animal

Â (CO)VARIANCES
Â 0.895993E-03
OPTION cat 2
OPTION prior 3 4 -1 4
OPTION solution mean 1 2 3 4 5


But the program thrgibbs1f90.exe can not run.
It shows me the result as : RANDOM_RESIDUAL not found, and then stop.


Could anyone help me to fix it?
Thank you very much
