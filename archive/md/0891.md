Dear All,
I am running the threshold model for categorical traits in combination with continuous trait, using THRGIBBS1F90.
I have 3 traits and 7 effects (4 fixed effects and 3 random effects)
random effects are: direct, maternal and permanent environmental from the dams.
I have added three options as
OPTION cat 2 2 0
OPTION prior 6 24 7 24 5 7OPTION solution mean
I have the problem when I try to set the degree of belief for the residual variance,  THRGIBBS1F90 could not wotk. For examlple:OPTION prior 6 24 7 24 5 7  # working fine, 6: direct, 7: maternal, 5: permanent 
OPTION prior 6 24 7 24 5 7 -1 7  # THRGIBBS1F90 did not run
1/ What should I do to be able to set the degree of belief for my residual variance ?2/ My first 2 traits are categorical traits. I expected THRGIBBS1F90 automatically recognise 0 as missing value; am I right?3/ But I also have some "real" 0 values in my continuous trait (not missing value). What can I do to make THRGIBBS1F90 understand my situation asI have some 0 in my categorical traits: missing values.I have some 0 in my continuous traits: real 0 values.
Many thanks for your attention and help.
