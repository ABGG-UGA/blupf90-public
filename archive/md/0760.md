Again,
Thank you for your kind answer.

Thus I am not sure of what to do with THRGIBBS.
When I use OPTION solution mean X or OPTION fixed_var mean X, the file final_solution does contain the EBV estimated for the tested traits ?

I am sorry for those very silly questions but the faq, read.me and te Blupf90 manual are not really friendly to new users for this matter.

Julien.
