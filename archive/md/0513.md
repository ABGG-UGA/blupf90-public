Thank Shogo very much. It is really the big help for me.
Is it possible for me to have another question?
I am trying to run the animal model for the categorical trait " stillborn", 
which have the value 1: stillborn and 0: alive
I create the parameter file, which contains


 DATAFILE
renf90.dat       # the data file              
 NUMBER_OF_TRAITS
1                   # one trait : stillborn
 NUMBER_OF_EFFECTS
5
 OBSERVATION(S)
1
 WEIGHT(S)
  
 EFFECTS: POSITIONS_IN_DATAFILE NUMBER_OF_LEVELS TYPE_OF_EFFECT  [EFFECT NESTED]
      2 60 cross # hys
      5 7 cross # parity
      6 2 cross # sex
      7 1 cov # total born
      8 1 cov # weight 


 RANDOM_RESIDUAL VALUES
 0.047924955          # I just use the variance of the simple variance calculation for this binary trait
RANDOM_GROUP
3                            # id
 RANDOM_TYPE
 add_animal
 FILE
renadd02.ped
 (CO)VARIANCES
 0.895993E-03
OPTION cat 2
OPTION prior 3 4 -1 4
OPTION solution mean 1 2 3 4 5


But the program thrgibbs1f90.exe can not run.
It shows me the result as : RANDOM_RESIDUAL not found, and then stop.


Could anyone help me to fix it?
Thank you very much
