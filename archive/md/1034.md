Dear Shogo
Hi



I simulated a 8 Traits project with correlated traits.
Traits 1 to 5 are sex limited traits.
In the seventh generation after intensive selection, blupf90 baise on ssGBLUP can not achieve convergence
When estimating EBV
in sex limited traits.
What is your suggestion to find the cause or its interpretation?
Please help me.
thanks.
