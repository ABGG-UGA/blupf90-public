Hello all:
I am running a repeatability test day model with fixed effects of herd-test day and fixed effects of DIM along with
f(thi) as a heat stress function for herd test day. I have a repeated records of a cow. How can I run f(thi) as a heat
stress function for herd test day? I need to estimate additive and permanent variance for general  and heat tolerance
effect and additive and permanent covariance between generic and heat tolerance effect for first lactation cows?
I will appreciate any help !
Thanks.
