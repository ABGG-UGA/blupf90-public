Thank Shogo, the bivariate random regression analyses worked.  My next question is how to get the coefficients for each
animal so that I can compute ebvs? Please help.

 One way is to assume that 3 parities are traits, so the data will beanimal  Trait 1  Trait 2  Trait 3	(common)
1		   1	      0 	 0	  1
1		   2	      0 	 0	  1
1		   0	      1 	 0	  1

Trait x includes everything (fixed effects, random effects, and observations) except for animal. If you put a common
fixed effect (e.g., herd, year, ....) for all 3 traits (parities), the convergence may be faster.


If you have 2 traits such as milk and protein, the observations should be within each parity. In that case, the total
number of traits will be 2 x 3 = 6.
