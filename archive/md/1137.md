```
To make clear:“last_solutions”, which is a binary file, is the same as “solutions”, which a text file,
containing only one last Gibbs sample. “binary_final_solutions” is a binary file containing posterior means using
all Gibbs samples. The “final_solutions”, which is a text file, will be the same as “binary_final_solutions”
with burn-in 0.  Shogo
