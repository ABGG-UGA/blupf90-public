You don't need "residual 1" for binary traits. The residual variance is automatically going to be 1 for binary traits.
And observations should be 1 and 2 (not 0 and 1). If you don't get 1 for the residual variance, the model may not be
good to fit. Also, starting values for covariance matrices are better to use 1 or less.
