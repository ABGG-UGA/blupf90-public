Dear allI am writing a parameter card for Gibbs1f90.I find an option to write priors in it.OPTION prior eff1 db1
......I am not able to understand what is meant by degrees of belief.I have only one trait to analyse that is
categorical. So I am using Thrgibbs1f90 for analysis.Do I need to use that option in renumf90? and if yes, then what
does it actually mean?thanks and regards,
```
