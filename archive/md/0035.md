Dear all,

 I have a question about the option to continue a chain from its last iteration for Gibbs2f90. The readme files only
state that this can be indicated in the parameter file by 'OPTION cont <number of last iteration>' but when I do this,
it requires a 'last_solution' file. I don't have this file, since the model did not finish properly, but crashed. How
can I create the proper 'last_solution' file, which information is the software looking for in this?

 Thanks
 Sjengske
