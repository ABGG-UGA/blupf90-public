Hi,

 I wonder if the AIC value produced with AIREMLF90 can be used to compare 
 different models.
 For example to decide if adding a fixed effect in a model improve the 
 model.
 In this discussion P. Dixon said that the AIC produces in lmer() cannot 
 be used for this kind of comparison.
 Is it the same for the AIC produce by airemlf90?

 Thanks in advance,
 Regards
 Julie Hamon
