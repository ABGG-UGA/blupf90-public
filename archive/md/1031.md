Hi Sungbong,


Although I have already replied to your email personally, I show some general ways how to put the dam-effect in the
model.



Considering the dam effect in the model, you have two options: 1) dam as genetic effect and 2) dam as independent
random effect. The first option results in the direct-maternal model which assumes the genetic correlation between the
direct and the maternal (dam) effects. The second option is a model with an additional random effect. Using RENUMF90,
the first option can be done with the OPTIONAL keyword in the animal genetic effect and you don't have to specify the
dam ID as a separate effect. The second option is done by putting RANDOM/diagonal to the dam ID. See the manual for
details.



Some maternal models (especially the direct-maternal genetic model) will be slow to get the convergence in REML because
the model is too complicated or simply wrong. Probably you have to force the genetic correlation between the direct and
the maternal genetic effects be 0. Or, just give up the maternal genetic effects and make it be an uncorrelated random
effect.
