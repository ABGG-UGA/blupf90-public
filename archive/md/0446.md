 The Hessian is computed at each estimate and AIREML gives an estimate of the true Hessian. I doÂ  not see conceptual problem in putting estimates from REML in AIREML, running ONE iteration of AIREML, obtaining the Hessian, then getting s.e. If the REML estimate is fine, then the Hessian is fine.

 Another question is, as Shogo says, whether the estimates make sense as they are obtained by EM. In my experience, if parameters are very closed to the boundaries (for instance h2=0.99) EM is more trustable than AI because the Hessian in boundary conditions makes bad approximations.

  Â Thank Shogo
 We want to run aireml to get the error. Your solution 3 is want we have done so far, but this is not elegant at all. We are putting emreml estimates on the aireml hessian.... That why we would like to improve it a bit.
 Thank you
 Juan Pablo

Â Juan Pablo,


When AI-REML doesn't converge, usually I try:
1) run with "OPTION EM-REML xxx", in this case, xxx can be between 100 and 174"
2) put the estimates from EM-REML in the parameter file, run AI-REML until convergence or with "OPTION maxrounds 0".
3) run with "OPTION tol x.x", where x.x can be very small value (e.g., < 1d-12); the default is 1d-12, which is the eigenvalue to reconstruct the covariance matrix when it is non-positive definite.


EM-REML forces to converge even when there are no covariances or it is impossible to estimate (i.e., non-positive definite). Usually, I don't trust EM estimates when AI-REML doesn't converge, so I always check with other programs. If you got the estimates from EM-REML, why do you need to run AI-REML anyway?
