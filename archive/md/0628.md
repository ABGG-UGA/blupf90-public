I continued my life with the false hope that some day I would get another chance to visit my paradise once again. I caught a glimpse of that chance for the last time when one of my friends had told me about the stock market.He took me to a stock exchange office and showed me how the stock market was handled. I looked at a screen with names and numbers on it which I couldn’t fathom the least. He told me that if you buy a commodity or a currency or gold or whatever on that screen, and if the market goes up I could win twelve and a half dollars with each point, and that the broker could help me to win at least 50 points a day, and sometimes I could win thousands of dollars in one jump if the market goes a limit up, and vice versa if I sell and the market goes a limit down. He gave me false hopes that one never loses and might become a millionaire in less than a year. All I had to do was get 4000 dollars to open an account. He had also been fooled to believe that.I was so fooled to believe what he had just explained to me that I ran to visit the nicest and most generous and beneficiary human being on the face of earth. He was the LATE RATEB AMHAZ (ABOU TALAL).He had been the benefactor and financial helper of my orphan family and the provider of their daily needs whenever he saw fit to do that. He was also the good Samaritan who had paid half the price of the plane ticket upon my departure to the US, in addition to another 400 dollars as pocket money to spend in the States.When I asked him to join in that business enterprise with me and provide me with the 4000 dollars needed for that promising project, he never hesitated. He accompanied me the next day to the bank and withdrew the 4000 dollars and handed them to me with a smile and a good luck.I put the money in an account and handed that account to an ignorant broker. He started to lose money instead of gaining it. He had told me that the market is not stable and that such things happen all the time. I had lost a 1000 dollars the first week. The second week I was left with only 2000 dollars, with which he bought a cotton contract. The next day the cotton went the first limit down, and the day after the next limit down, and all I was left with was an empty account. I had lost the 4000 dollars and I saw and felt nothing but a black cloud that had enveloped my miserable being.I didn’t know what to think or what to say to my benefactor and good Samaritan THE LATE ABOU TALAL.While I was shouting and crying in the office a person approached me and said that there was an international company he had been dealing with which hired only the best brokers in the world. He assured me that they never lose. All I had to do was to get 10,000 dollars to open an account. The 4000 dollars were required only from fake companies like the one I used to deal with, and not like the international companies that needed a larger capital.I could have told THE LATE ABOU TALAL about what had happened and I was sure he would have forgiven me and never said anything bad to hurt my feelings. But I was ashamed to face him and look as a crafty who had fooled him out of his honest money. I couldn’t do that to him. Instead I thought that I might have a chance with that other international company to compensate our loss and gain more money.I visited him in his house with a broad smile on my face. I told him that I had won a thousand dollars but I needed another 10,000 dollars to open an account with the 15,000 dollars in an international company so we could double the amount every month or even more. I gave him the choice of splitting the profit and continue with the old company.He refused to split the money and accompanied me the next day and withdrew another 10,000 dollars and handed them to me with a broader smile and lots of good lucks.I opened a new account and handed it to a broker in that company. The next day he lost 500 dollars. And the next another 500 dollars. And his losses accumulated to 3000 dollars just in two weeks. I lost my mind and temper and didn’t know what to do. I relieved him of the responsibility of handling my account and took that responsibility myself, after I had acquired certain experience in the stock market. I had invented a mathematical method that depended on drawing a graph to follow the movements of the market and discover the points at which the market might go up or down. I started to win. Sometimes I won a hundred dollars, and at other times I won 200 dollars or even more. I lost from time to time 50 or 100 dollars because I used to stop my losses at certain points. I won about a thousand dollars in three weeks, and things started to brighten up again.I hadn't seen THE LATE ABOU TALAL in more than a month and a half, which prompted him to send me a verbal message with one of my relatives requesting to see me.When I had gone to see him he asked me about my account and I lied to him and said that I had made only 5000 dollars as a profit, because the market was slow. I felt that he was beginning to question my honest motives and requested that I withdraw 10,000 dollars, and work with the other 10,000, because he was going through a financial problem that needed some cash. I told him that I would get it to him the next day, but I never showed up. I only had less than 7000 dollars on me, because I had quit my teaching job and took residence in a hotel near the company, and had spent more than a 1000 dollars on food, clothes, hotel rent, and other expenses.I sent him a message telling him that I was threatened by an international mafia, and that they had sent me to get his money or they would kill me. I thought I would buy some time, because I had met a person who had told me that he worked in the central bank of Lebanon, and that he could give me some tips on the Lebanese exchange market to win lots of money. He requested that I split the profits with him. I agreed to do that, and withdrew my account from the company and put it in a local exchange office after buying a wireless to give orders for buying or selling in the Lebanese exchange market.The newest broker started to give me his false tips, and I began to lose more and more money. After a month I had lost more than 2000 dollars, in addition to another 2000 or more on expenses that needed much more money because I had become a renegade chased by police and local military militias.At the end, I was caught and put under the custody of a local military militia for exactly 40 days and nights, where I was beaten, humiliated, and treated every single hour of those ominous days and nights, with the most cruelty a man would ever experience in his life.That was nothing compared to the unlimited feeling of disgust and hatred upon my dirty being for the mischievous and dishonest act I had played on the best and most honest beneficiary and Samaritan I had ever crossed paths with in my entire miserable and sad life.I returned to the village after my release and worked as a teacher for some years. But life was miserable and the salary was worse. All I was thinking of was to return to my paradise, and with what I was doing, I couldn’t achieve that. So I went in search of my fortune in the capital city of Beirut one more timeI went down from the village with only 30 dollars on me. I used 10 dollars to rent a bed in one corner of the open corridor of a renting place to sleep for a month. The lady in that house felt sorry for me, and brought a bed and put it in the corridor just for me to sleep on, after I had told her that I only have 10 dollars to pay for rent. I spent the rest of the money on food, while I walked long distances in search for a job. I used to buy a kilo of bread that I always had in a shoulder bag to eat during three days. I used to buy a kilo of yogurt from time to time to eat with the bread. I spent the money after three weeks. I only bought two decent sandwiches, and ate two free decent meals at a friend of mine, during that period of three long and hard weeks. I had to go hungry for the rest of the month, except when I ate from some trees that had some kind of strange but edible small berry like fruits, along with some damaged fruits that sellers used to throw at the end of the day. I used to collect and devour the good parts of them after extracting the damaged parts.Destiny smiled at me exactly one day before the end of the month, and I found a job in a restaurant as a waiter. But I had faced a major and big problem. I had to buy a black tuxedo, two shirts, a necktie, black socks, and a black shoe for work. I also had to rent a decent room for at least a hundred dollars a month, to keep my stuff in, clean my shirts, and shower everyday, after the long and hard day of work. I needed at least five hundred dollars of which I hadn't even a dime on me.I visited a young man from my village who was continuing his education in Switzerland to get his doctorate degree in chemistry. I had seen him a month ago in the village exactly at the same day before I went down to the city of Beirut. This time he had returned to the house of his parents in the city. He had previously asked me, while we were chatting in the village, if I could get him some ten thousand faked dollars, because it was easy to circulate them in Switzerland without being caught.I took advantage of that incident, and faced him with the fact that I had seen some gang, and that they were willing to sell me the ten thousand faked dollars for only five hundred real dollars. He refused to do that and told me that he had reconsidered the matter and didn’t want anything to do with faked money, because it was not safe and that would endanger his life and professional career.I didn’t take no for an answer, and told him that the gang had already prepared the money for me, and if I didn’t come up with the five hundred dollars today, they would not hesitate to kill me. I gave him only one choice, and that to go himself to the gang and reason them out, and convince them of returning the faked money.He got very frightened, and that was exactly my intention. I had meditated and considered deeply that devilish scheme the night before, and had all the possible answers to all the questions and doubts he would face me with.At the end, we reached a reasonable deal. He would pay me four hundred dollars, and I would pay the rest. I agreed to that last choice.I wrote him a letter the next day, and sent it with a mutual friend and a relative of mine, telling him that the gang had beaten me up and hadn't given me the faked money, and that they had threatened to kill me and him if we ever told anyone about that.I guess he was satisfied to get rid of me and the faked money, even though he had lost four hundred dollars, because he hadn't told anyone of that incident except the mutual friend who had delivered the letter to him, and knew of its content, due to the fact that I had intended deliberately to give it to him open and without an envelope, to let him read its content and know about the deal of the faked money between us, in case he said that I had borrowed the money from him, or invented a different story.Destiny was so merciless with me this time, and destroyed all the beautiful things that I had relished all my life, and had paid dearly for. I gaveup all my beliefs and ideals, because I was faced with one of two choices. I either returned to the village empty handed and a failure like I had always done, or killed my miserable self. I was a coward to kill myself, and was so ashamed to return to the village once again a failure, because I was nothing but a complete failure since I returned from the States. So I resorted to a third and most difficult choice, a one that had never ever entered my mind. It was the worst decision I had ever taken in my whole life, and all I was left with was a strong and out of the world feeling of the most profound guilt and disgust towards my dirty and devilish self.I worked for about two months in that restaurant, but I couldn’t compete with the old waiters who gave me a very bad time. They succeeded at the end in defeating me and causing the supervisor to end my services, because I wasn’t as good as they were. It was the first time that I worked in Lebanese restaurants as a waiter, and their line of work was completely different than the easy line of the American restaurants, that didn’t require very high professionalism, and also because most Americans didn’t like to work in restaurants, which left only foreign students, and especially Lebanese to take over that line of business. The situation was different in Lebanon, because the competition was strong and required high professionalism, and I lacked both of them.I looked for another job for about two months and in that period I had spent almost all the money that I had made from working in the first restaurant. I had to be very miser and economize to the maximum in my expenditures. I had great experience in surviving such harsh circumstances due to my previous miserable situations that I had gone through in the States and in the last hunger strike before I found the last job.I succeeded to find work in another restaurant, but this time I faced a very professional waiter and the only waiter working in that restaurant. He was making very good money from the tips that he used to accumulate alone. Being another waiter with him meant that I competed with him on the tips, and that made him the worst petty tyrant I had ever worked with in restaurants. He eventually defeated me and caused the owner to fire me even before I ended my month.I hadn't made enough money to survive the hard times that I encountered again in my search for another work. This time I spent all the money that I had saved except for the room rent. I had one month to look for a job, but I was penniless. I had no bread or yogurt to devour. I only had rotten fruits and edible berry like trees to feed on. I spent two weeks wandering in the streets looking for a job and feeding on edible trees and rotten fruits and vegetables.I was so hungry that I had no recourse but to eat from the garbage. I used to stand near fast food restaurants awaiting the chance for someone to throw what was left of his or her sandwich in the garbage can. I used to devour the leftovers like a hungry vulture, or you might say a hungry miserable dog.The month ended without me finding any job. I was left with no other choice but to go back to the village or get suicide. But since death was my worst enemy and the most fearful entity that scared the shit out of my wits since I was five years old, I didn't dare take that last action that would have ended my miserable shitty life, and returned to the village with a devastated and demolished heart, dragging behind my usual failure once again.I had perpetrated the worst sin ever just to avoid going back to the village as a failure. But destiny was more and more and more merciless with me than ever before, and I returned instead as a sinful and a humiliated garbage eater failure.But in the last stages of my path, I reached the light at the end of the tunnel, when destiny opened its full arms to me, after it had opened the gates of hell on me, upon my return to my homeland. I eventually became a man of knowledge. Infinity had revealed its designs to me after all. I was chosen to prepare the way before humanity to reach either salvation or extinction. I was one of the many and many humble human beings throughout history, who were visited by death and destiny to accomplish certain tasks designed by Infinity.I understood that the story of our ancestors Adam and Eve was no more than a metaphor to teach a certain lesson, and that the Garden of Eden was no place outside our beloved mother earth. I knew that I was the latest man of knowledge, and the humblest of them, who will pave the way before humanity to reach a higher level of evolution. I am not in the line of knowledge and power of prophets. I am just an ordinary humble man of knowledge whose only task is to reveal certain truths and warn our fellow human beings that we either follow the path of love, forgiveness and charity to reach global peace and harmony, and develop the two scientific realms of Nano technology and genetic engineering to make earth into our own heaven, or the human race would face another major extinction, where only millions of human beings would survive, while the rest would perish.Human beings are destined to reach a certain level of awareness, and develop new branches of science such as Nano technology and genetic engineering to raise the state of their evolution into a new and completely different line of extraordinary human ancestry that would have total control over matter and energy and the human gene. Humans would take a different turn in evolution and would make beloved mother earth into their own heaven, and themselves into a highly developed kind of living sentient beings.You will find more explanation and truths about the evolution of creation, life, and humans in the article titled the big bang, death and destiny, and evolution that follows the article titled the ultimate goal of humanity,My beloved friend and companion death and destiny will not cease to stalk me relentlessly and without mercy, and would never give me the slightest break to catch up my breath, in spite of being a very sick middle-aged man, and the poorest on the face of our beloved mother earth, and the most miserable one of all. But, regardless of all that, I am the humble man of knowledge that holds the key to delivering my beloved brothers and sisters in God and knowledge and humanity to safety, through the path of love, forgiveness, and charity, if they only wish to do that. Ain't that the weirdest mystery in existence dear folks?!
