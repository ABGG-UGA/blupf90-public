Hi Deligth,


For your convenience, I uploaded a binary of binsol_to_textsol for 64bit Linux. Please visit our repo.


http://nce.ads.uga.edu/html/projects/programs/Linux/Temp/



If you use the above binary, the following discussion can be ignored. Speaking of the original source file, it is a
Fortran program and you can compile it by yourself using GFortran on Linux. The previous source file has a coding
issue, and I have already fixed it on the repository. Please use the new one.
