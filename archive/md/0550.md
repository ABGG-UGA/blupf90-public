 Pigs like broilers usually use cor(g,y-xb)/h. See recent papers from our group,e.g., 
 GSE (2015) 47:56.  They should include references.  ACCF90 is an approximation.Ignacy

Dear Prof,

 This is Cheng Tan from University of Minnesota. I'm working on pig genomic selection.


 I want to compare the accuracy between pedigree-BLUP and ssGBLUP, but I'm not sure how to calculate it. There is not a formula in the manual,and just say that EBV accuracy can be calculated based on se for EBV. I found a formula 1-se*se/Va somewhere, and I want to confirm it with you.


 What's more, many public papers show kinds of formula for accuracy, for example, cor(g,y), cor(g,y-xb), cor(g,y-xb)/h, or others...... What do you think of them. And which one would you recommend?


 Finally, I can not find ACCF90, could anyone send me the program? tanxx590@...


 Looking forward  to your reply.Thanks.


 Best wishes,




 Cheng
