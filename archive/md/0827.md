Hi,


I was having the very same questions a couple of weeks ago and did not receive any answer yet.


From my research on that topic, I ASSUME (I am all but sure) that degrees of belief is the same as degrees of freedom
in the prior inverse Wishart / inverse chi-squared distribution of the covariance matrix / component. I have this
assumption from notes associated with the programmes, e.g. http://nce.ads.uga.edu/~ignacy/course11.pdf. Search for
"belief" in it and compare the posterior distribution with its specification in other papers.



The covariance matrix of multiple-traits you specify in the parameter file is then either the mode, the mean, or the
scale matrix of the inverse Wishart distribution, or the single-trait variance component is the mode or mean of the
inverse chi-square distribution respectively.
From my tests with the code I assume it is the mode, but there I am even unsurer than with the degrees of belief.


Maybe someone from the programme can answer this question definitly?



Best,
Katrin
