The absolute tyranny of destiny befell me at the age of one year old, when my new born little brother came into existence at a most crucial interval of the life of any human child who needs the nurturing and loving care of its mother to help him or her in its second and most important year in his or her life to develop his or her character and personality that determine the outcome of his or her future ambitions, hopes, and dreams.Death visited me the first time at the age of three when it took away the life of my second new born brother, and the second time, at the age of four, when it took the life of my third new born brother.The absolute tyranny of destiny befell me more harshly since then after it granted my first little new born brother the chance to receive the nurturing and loving care of my mother for the first four years of his life, and allowed him to develop a strong personality and distinguished character, and armed with high ambitions and strong will of survival abilities, he became the dominating male, while I ended up the subversive one with weak personality and undeveloped character, and armed with no ambitions and a very low will of survival abilities, my childish years saw no more than a desperate, sad, and harsh livelihood, before and after I fell at the mercy of my little petty tyrant brother who used to beat and torture me all the time.The absolute and meanest tyranny of death and destiny befell me at the age of five, when they collaborated mercilessly and without any kindness to deliver a decisive blow into the innocent years of my childhood, after they put me at a scene that shattered the worldly foundations of my desperate, sad, and harsh life.The mysterious designs of Infinity were schemed so that death and destiny bring me into a place where I witnessed the fall of a young and innocent child from the roof of a four storey building, down into the street where I was standing near our house, and his tender little head was smashed into pieces in front of my very horrified eyes, and bones, brains, blood, and flesh were splattered all over me.The tyranny of death and destiny befell upon me with two more bloody and horrifying events, where I witnessed the stabbing of a man at exactly the same very spot where I had witnessed the falling of the innocent child, and the slashing of the back of another man with a very sharp knife at another place not very far from our house.The tyranny of death and destiny hasn’t stopped at befalling me with unusually designed events that happened to other people, but also with bloody events that befell me personally and caused painful physical and psychological harm to my innocent childhood, over the next four years.I would only mention two of the bloodiest and most painful incidents that I had ever experienced and witnessed in my previous childish life.The first bloody incident took place when I was about six years old. It happened that I was coming out of the building that faced the one we used to live in, and at the moment I got out of the gate and stepped on the pavement, I glanced a man pounding a long piece of rod with a chisel on the other pavement across the street, in front of the bakery under our house, and in a flash of an eye, I saw the man stand up with horror in his eyes, while he ran like a mad man towards me. I thought he wanted to inflict some harm upon my desperate being. The moment he reached my spot I felt a warm stuff gushing out of my face, and saw later a fountain of blood flowing all over that ominous face and covering all my chest, to an extent that I was drowning in a pool of blood. The fear and shock that I had experienced were so outlandish that I only woke up in a hospital, under the mercy of a nurse attending my wound, while I felt the most horrifying pain and fear I had ever experienced in the previous life of my desperate and sad childhood.What had happened at that time defied all the physical laws of force and gravity known in the universe. While the man was pounding the long piece of rod, infinity destined that a short piece of that rod come out in a way that contradicted all the deductive and scientific reasoning of the human mind, and launch like a rocket to hit my eyebrow, after crossing a distance of about 8 or 9 meters, and cause a very deep and wide wound in the middle of my right eyebrow, and even reach the bone and cut it slightly too.Death had become my eternal enemy and executioner from that time on. I was up to that moment witnessing death as an outside horrifying dark force that snatched away the lives of my two new born brothers, and that of an innocent boy, and caused the stabbing and slashing of two more other human beings. But I had never ever experienced its merciless tyranny personally, till it had inflicted the most painful and horrifying harm upon my miserable being, to the point that it had become the eternal ghost that haunted me after that during all my future desperate and sad life.The second most bizarre and horrifying incident that had inflicted upon my petty being the most psychological and emotional pain I had ever experienced in my previous life, took place when I was about 8 or 9 years old.The incident took place exactly where I had been inflicted with the deep wound 2 or 3 years ago. A relative of mine, who was an innocent and peaceful boy of my age, had come to visit me from his neighborhood. While we were both chatting and playing at that ominous place, he stood exactly at the same very spot where I had received that ominous wound. Infinity destined, without his awareness or will, that he put his little finger between the two scissors at the back end of the ominous iron gate of that ominous building, and me close that ominous gate without my awareness or will either. The only thing I remember was his out of the world cry accompanied with the most horrifying pain and horror I had ever seen another innocent boy experience. I saw a little smashed and cut finger with its tip and a little more dripping loose and attached only to what was left of smashed bone.Memories of all the previous horrifying events that I had experienced in my previous miserable life flooded my mind and a torrent of mixed feelings of fear, sadness and misery culminated into a single feeling of supreme guilt and injustice which invaded my poor soul, accompanied by the most bizarre and out of the world psychological and emotional pain I had experienced at that moment, were more than my weak and desperate heart could stand. I had felt that I became an unjust and merciless executioner who inflicted great harm upon an innocent and peaceful boy. All I was left with was a feeling of mercy and peacefulness that followed, and filled my innocent and miserable heart during all my future desperate life, in a way that no living human being on the face of earth would ever understand, unless he went through the same sufferings I had experienced throughout all my previous desperate life. My heart would break and my eyes would cry at the least view of injustice or pain or suffering I would witness happening with other people. I couldn’t hurt a fly after that, and became so peaceful and merciful that I never dared inflict the slightest harm upon any creature in the world during all my future petty life.Infinity designed that destiny have mercy with me at the age of nine after defeating my little petty tyrant brother, which raised my hopes and ambitions at the age of ten, to defeat my classmates in my fifth elementary school year, and succeed to reach the first level in my class, and the fourth in Lebanon, in the official final examinations, at the age of eleven.But Infinity decided once more that the tyranny of destiny shatter this time the foundations of my victorious and ambitious life, after my path was crossed with another meanest petty tyrant, who caused hell itself to descend upon my petty being in the first intermediate class, where he used to beat the shit out of me in school all the time, and I ended up falling in my final examinations, and all my false hopes and ambitions evaporated in thin air, and was left with more desperation and sadness than I had ever experienced in my previous childish years of my petty horrifying life.All I was left with to alleviate my desperation and sadness was my handsome face, which allowed me to communicate with lovely young girls of my age, whom their sweet and innocent compassion compensated all the loving care that I lacked in my childish years. But again, Infinity decided that the tyranny of destiny befall upon me more harshly this time, and my innocent handsome face was invaded by a horrible number of the most ugly and disgusting pimples, that turned my face into a pool of red and puked huge balls of blisters scattered over every possible spot in that ominous face. I ended up this time leading a lonely and miserable ugly life, secluding my petty self away from society, and communicating the possible least with any human, because of the fear that they might get disgusted with such an ugly beast.Death and destiny delivered a very emotional blow upon me during the civil war, at the age of sixteen, when they collaborated this time to bereave me of my only friend and my only other good companion in life. They were my closest friend and cousin, and a goodhearted middle aged man, who used to alleviate some of my sadness with his sweet company and funny jokes. They both died with a bomb in front of my very favorite spot under our house, where I used to sit all the time, since I was two years old, watching people and meditating my sad and desperate petty life.Infinity decided to send death and destiny, once again, to deliver the most merciless and harsh blow upon my petty self, at the age of eighteen, when my father got sick with cancer, and I had to sit with him in the AUB hospital in Beirut, for two long months, watching him wither in front of my very eyes, and witnessing the non-merciful claws of death while they were slowly entering deeper and deeper inside his weak and helpless body to snatch his life away.The books of Gibran Khalil Gibran were my only haven and solace, since I was eleven and a half years old, to alleviate some of my loneliness, sadness, and harsh circumstances that I was experiencing during my agony with the my meanest petty tyrant at school, and during my seclusion after the invasion of the ugly pimples, which answered some of the myriads of question that I had about life, sadness, and death.But Infinity was not completely harsh with me. It had saved me miraculously on many occasions from certain deaths during the civil war and over the period prior to my departure to the US. I would mention only three of them.The first miraculous event took place at the beginning of the civil war at the age of 16 years old, when I had decided to visit my aunt, very close to the neighborhood of the innocent and peaceful boy I had harmed in my childhood, which was many blocks away from our house.When I reached the vicinity of her house, I heard a loud and deafening explosion at exactly the same very moment I was about to step inside the street. I saw a great number of human bodies which lay scattered all over the street either dead or very wounded. Some were torn to pieces with mutilated hands and legs and chopped bodies. Some were on the verge of dying, while others were crying silently for help. The nearest and the first human body I had approached belonged to a young man of about my age, whose face was shredded to pieces, with all the flesh on it torn out and the bones peaking out. The only thing that was alive were his horrified eyes that looked up at me and pleaded for help. The moment I gazed into his horrified eyes I knew that death had stared me straight in my own eyes. I felt death with some unknown hidden part deep inside my poor soul, whispering to me silently in a mysterious way that I was about to face the same fate, but God the Almighty had decided to save my miserable life. I understood right away the reason behind all the previous visits of death and destiny in my childhood, and that the designs of Infinity would be revealed to me someday in my future life.The second more bizarre and outlandish event happened to me two years later, when I was selling my used school books under a bridge very close to the destroyed downtown of the divided city of Beirut. Three villain guys of my age or even older had approached me and threatened that I either hand them my used books or I would be killed. I tried to reason them out, but there was no way to make them change their evil schemes. When I was about to surrender to their deadly and serious threats and let them plunder my books, some unknown and mysterious power that I had never ever experienced in my whole cowardly life overtook me, and I refused to grant them their wishes.The next thing I saw was the three of them suddenly charging at me to beat the shit out me, at first, and eventually end that miserable life of mine, but that same mysterious power that had landed upon my weak and cowardly heart from nowhere, converted me into an unknown and mysterious being. It was as if I had a black belt in martial arts, because I began to fend off their onslaughts with fast arms and legs movements and were not able to touch me, except for one slap that one of them had delivered unto my neck at the beginning of the fight due to the suddenness of their mischievous and evil attack.In the midst of all that was happening, which lasted more than five minutes, I turned my head to the back without my intention or will, and saw one of them holding a very sharp knife and was about to stab me with it in the back. In a reaction that was extremely bizarre and mysterious to me, which I witnessed and executed in what seemed a slow motion, I grabbed the hand of the attacker and snatched his knife, then pointed it at the three of them. They looked with open mouths and horrified eyes and fled away as if a demon was stalking them.The last event that had happened to me at the age of 19, took place when I drowned at sea and was saved in a way that is still a mystery to me up to this very day, because I was drifted deep into the sea, where the mighty waves of a huge current moved me like a helpless rag up and down amidst the worst hurricane of water, where I fought for my life for an unknown period of time, and the minute I gave up myself to death I saw my body near the beach, where I stood up on my legs and walked up the sand completely exhausted, and after I fell down half conscious, I experienced the most wonderful and out of the world feeling, and I knew right away that a flame of Divinity had touched my weak and innocent heart, and I witnessed the existence of God in a way that words cannot describe in any reasonable way.Infinity paved the way for me, in the year of 1979. to go to the US as a student, at Portland Community College, in the state of Oregon. The minute my legs touched the promised land I experienced an unprecedented peace of mind and happiness that I had never ever felt before in my sad and desperate previous life, and I knew that I was reborn in The Heavens.I began reading the bible and followed the teachings of Jesus Christ to the letter, and started going to churches. I felt a kind of love for my fellow human beings that words alone cannot describe. I was full of love, forgiveness, and happiness.But again the hardships of life was more than my poor situation could stand. I was making $600 a month working in restaurants as a dish washer and a busboy, and after the tax deduction I would be left only with 400 or 450 dollars. I had to save for the college, the room rent, the food, the transportation, and all other needs from them, but that was impossible. I had to go one semester and skip another in order for me to be able to save 900 dollars for each one. Sometimes I ate one meal a day and sometimes I used to go hungry without food for two days when I was off work, and used to wait till I went to the restaurant to eat my meal there.Complete sadness and desperation invaded me this time. I was lonely in a faraway land, penniless and hungry. The flame that had touched my heart started to wither, till it faded away completely, and all I was left with was an eternal hatred for God, and he turned into my worst enemy.My only recourse was reading books in all kinds of religions and philosophies. With time I came to understand a little more about the designs of infinity, and in spite of my sadness and desperation, I had hope that some day I would be saved, and God would deliver me to safety. But Infinity had decided a different fate for me, and I was deported from the US in mid 1982. I had gone through the same agony, the same pain, and the same loss that had befallen our ancestors Adam and Eve, because I was cast out of my own heaven.I could have avoided the deportation, and would have stayed in the States, and continued my normal life, and made enough money to finish my education and end all my miseries, in case I had done something that contradicted with all my ideals, and gave away all that I had previously believed inA year or so before the deportation I got my liquor permit at the age of 21 years old, which allowed me to work as a waiter. After working for some time in a restaurant with a relative of mine, and after he saw that I was still having financial problems regarding my tuition fees and my way of living, he told me that I could make enough money to get out of my misery, and pay my fees, and live a good life without the need to skip any semester, and that I would even save a thousand dollars or so each month.All I had to do was to steal money from the cash register of the restaurant, because the waiter himself was also the cashier responsible for issuing the bills to the customers. He showed me a way to play with the bills without being caught in any way. He told me that he had been doing it himself for some time and was never caught. Being the supervisor, he was able to follow a legal procedure in which he could cancel a paid bill and consider it a returned one after he signed it, and the high administration of the restaurant and the hotel would not doubt the fraud act in any way. He told me to choose any bill with whatever amount of money each day and he would sign it, and I would take that stolen money to enjoy it anyway I pleasedI refused to do so because I couldn’t imagine myself becoming a crafty and a thief. That was more than I could handle. Any normal sane person in my situation would have done that to save himself, but I guess I was not that sane or normal at all.Eight months before the deportation he arranged that I marry the sister of his girlfriend in order to get the green card, with her previous knowledge that our marriage was a fixed one only to get the green card, and she had agreed to that.Three months after our marriage she told me that she wanted to have a baby. I was still young and a student and above all, was not ready to have a baby, especially that I was not in love with her. That contradicted with my beliefs of the idea of marriage. I could at least have fooled her and lied to her into believing that I would do that in the near future after my financial situation got better, in order to buy some time till I got my green card after only three more months, and would have kicked her out of my life without endangering my situation, but that also contradicted with my previous beliefs about fooling people and being dishonest and cruel to them. Again, any sane and normal person would have done that, but I guess my fate was destined not to be a sane and normal person after all.I told her that I didn’t want to live with her anymore and asked her to leave. She called me many times after that telling me that she would do anything to return to me, but I refused to do that, fearing that she would fool me and get pregnant without my knowledge or agreement. Five months later I got a phone call from the immigration office telling me that they wanted to have an interview with me. The minute I entered the office they locked me in prison and told me that I had a court session after ten days to decide my stay in the States, either I would stay, which was almost impossible, or they would deport me without having the chance ever to return to the States again. They gave me though another choice in which I would ask for the deportation myself before the court session, and in that case I could return to the states after a year or so.I decided to resort to a fourth choice. I had a girlfriend who had agreed to marry me before the court session in case I got out of prison. I needed 2000 dollars to bail me out before the court session convened. I asked the sister of the same relative of mine that they both seek a Saudi friend of mine to get the 2000 dollars from him. That Saudi friend was the nicest human being I had ever met on the face of earth, and he agreed immediately to do that. The next day, my relative came to the immigration office with his sister, who was my best friend, and who had played a major role in mediating to get me the bail money, and told me that he had the two thousand dollars with him, and he had even showed them to me, but he refused to pay them and bail me out. I implored him, and his sister did too, to pay the bail money, and I even agreed to steal money from the restaurant and do whatever he wanted me to do, but he refused. I guess he had given up on me, and knew that I would never change my ideals and live the reality of life.He had been a personification and an excellent reflection of that reality himself. Although he had the green card, and was making good money, and wasn’t paying any tuition fees for his education, and was living with his sister in the large and comfortable house of his older and married brother, and ate the best meals, and led the best life of a bachelor, but in spite of all that, he stole money from that restaurant and was never caught. That reality of life had proven to be very successful with him, for he is now an American citizen and a millionaire living happily ever after.I decided to concede to the immigration offer and ask for the deportation myself, in the hope that I would be able to return someday, but that never happened.The irony and cruelness of destiny is that at some time in my future life, and after years of my return from the States to my homeland I was forced to contradict all my previous beliefs in being an honest person who would never fool anyone and play a fraud act on him or steal his money.The minute my legs had landed again on the soil of my home land Lebanon, my heart became a void. No feelings. No hopes. No ambitions. Nothing but a dark, empty, sad, and desperate heart, full to the brim with hatred to my two eternal enemies: Infinity and life.The extraordinary events that took place after that decided my path.Upon my return to Lebanon during the Israeli occupation in mid 1982, I found out that the house that my family had been living in since 1977, and which my late father had occupied, after we had fled our old house during the civil war… I found out that the owner of the house, had been living with my mother and younger brothers and sisters in the same house, after he had divided it between them, and had been giving them very bad time and threatening them all the time to leave the house, which forced my little brother, who had been my tyrant in my childhood, to flee the house three months earlier, and rent a house in the suburbs of Beirut by himself.After a month of my arrival, we had to get the furniture out and leave the house, and live in the house that my little brother had rented in the suburbs, after he had left to live alone in another house.The only one who had been working and providing my family with the needs of living was my little brother who had fled the house earlier. Being the eldest son in the family, I had to take his place and pay the rent and provide for the needs of living, but since I was jobless and penniless, my mother and younger brothers and sisters left to the village, after my 14 years old brother found a job there, and I was left alone in Beirut with my eldest sister. We hadn't been paying the rent for two months and the owner started to threaten us either to pay or leave. After two weeks of the departure of my family, I had to leave the rented house with my eldest sister and join them in the occupied village in the south. We left all the furniture behind and fled empty handed one more time.I worked as a porter in the port of Tyre for some time. After that I succeeded to work on a ship that sailed between the Port of Tyre and Cypress. I saw hell during that month because I was always seasick and found it so hard to eat or sleep properly.After working as a laborer in the village for some time, I joined one of the private schools as an English teacher.I taught for two years making less than 200 dollars a month. I asked for a raise, but the owner of the school refused to grant me my request. I left the village and returned to 
 Beirut, after a relative of mine had fixed me a job as an English teacher in another private school he was teaching in. I lived at the house of another relative for a whole year.During the school year, the most extraordinary event took place.I had read an add in the newspaper requesting nurse translators to Saudi Arabia. I applied for the job and was tested along with others in English. Being an English teacher and a previous student in the States, I achieved the highest grade of all the contestants, because the major test consisted of listening to about a hundred questions which I answered all of them correctly.When I came back to learn about the results I was offered to become the head nurse translator of that hospital with a basic salary of 1500 dollars a month in addition to extra bonuses, which would all amount to 2000 dollars or more a month. I was informed that my salary would be raised each year.That was more than I could handle. I almost cried inside the office, but I had to control myself lest I become a ridicule. They requested that I bring my passport to get me the visa. I issued a new one and headed to the office full of hopes that I would visit my paradise after all. They took the passport and told me to come after a week to get it.All the time after my deportation from the States I had one obsession, and that to return to the promised land of my heaven. This time I saw a glimpse of light of making that dream come true.I couldn’t wait till that promised and happy day arrived. Upon entering the office of the supervisor whom I had made the deal with, I was told that all the visas to Saudi Arabia were postponed and the hospital stopped all application from Lebanon.I had learned that the next day after I had given them my passport the Saudi general consulate in West Beirut was attacked and burned by some militia men, and that visas were either cancelled or postponed.That destroyed all my renewed hopes that I had pinned on that job of changing my fate and achieving my dream of returning to my heaven in the States. But the dream of visiting my paradise again had vanished for ever, and the pain I had felt was much more harder than the one I had suffered upon my deportation.Things didn’t go well at the end of the school year and I was forced to quit. But destiny smiled at me after I had read an add in the newspaper requesting an English teacher in the mount of Lebanon far from the city of Beirut.I applied for the job and was accepted with a salary of about 800 dollars, and a free room to live in inside the school campus.I packed my stuff in a big traveling bag, and after thanking my relatives for their great hospitality, my other relative who had fixed me the teaching job, took me in his car and we headed straight to the place of my promised destination.I thought that with all the money I would be making, I could save at least 500 or 600 dollars a month, and during two or three years I would accumulate enough dollars to visit my heaven and see if I could find a way to stay there in some way or another. All I ever wanted was to feel again the sweet breeze of my paradise.When I entered the lobby I was faced by a mean looking militia man adherent to a certain military party asking me about my name and the reason of my visit. I told him my name and informed him that I was the new English teacher. He left me and came back after ten or fifteen minutes. He looked fiercely into my eyes and ordered me to leave the vicinity of the school because there was no more need for my teaching services. I insisted to meet the lady owner of the school. I waited for about four hours in the lobby. When I met her at last she told me that things had gotten out of her hand and there was nothing she could do about it, and that I had to leave the school and never come back again or something bad would befall me. I returned to the house of my relatives dragging behind my failure and my ominous traveling bag, and the dreams of visiting my paradise had vanished in thin air.Two weeks later I was horrified to learn from the newspaper that the lady owner and her woman principal were murdered in their rooms inside the vicinity of the school. I thanked God for being cast out of that ominous school, because if I had been there with them I would have certainly met the same fate. Destiny had saved me from the claws of death one more time.I went to live with my previous tyrant little brother, after I found another school and began to teach.
