Hi, I am new to this group and new to blupf90.	I am a graduate student in plant breeding and genetics at Oregon State.
 I have gotten a bunch of stuff to work in blupf90 but one thing still eludes me.  How do I get a custom relationship
matrix to work.  I have read the manual, Appendix J, but the instructions are not clear to me.	I am trying to get Rex
Bernardo's classic example of Morex, Robust, Excel, and Stander barley to work in blupf90. This is from pages 270 to
274 in his textbook "Breeding for Quantitative Traits in Plants". I converted the coefficient of coancestry from
tabular analysis into what I think is the correct format for blupf90:1 1 11 2 0.51 3 0.43751 4 0.343752 1 0.52 2 12 3
0.843752 4 0.6718753 1 0.43753 2 0.843753 3 13 4 0.71093754 1 0.343754 2 0.6718754 3 0.71093754 4 1I saved this file as
"barley_kin.txt" and then added it to the bottom of my parameter file as:"OPTION user_file barley_kin.txt"
As far as I can tell, the results do not seem to utilize my file in any way.  Can anyone give me help on this problem? 
Thank you in advance.Lyle
