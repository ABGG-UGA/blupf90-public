Dear all,

  

I need to remove or reduce co-variance matrix (A matrix) to change correlated random effect to uncorrelated random
effect (only for progeny) . How do I change A*σ_u^2  to I*σ_u^2 ? Can I analyze my data with BLUPF90 package and
subtract dependent variable of solution. Thanks,

Hossein
