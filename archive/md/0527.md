Dear all,

I had a problems when I were running postgibbs1f90  after thrgibbs1f90


Read  50000 samples from round 10 to 500000
Burn-in?
250000	  # I chose to burn-in 250000
Give n to read every n-th sample?
50    # I wanted to read every 50 samples


However, In the postgibbs_samples file as well as the graph, I found that the interval of the samples after burn-in was
50,000 - 300,000. 
Why did the program choose the interval in the middle instead of burn-in first 250,000 samples?
If I want the samples from 250,000 to 500,000, what should I do?


On the other hand, when I chose 10 for n to read every n-th sample. The burn-in is normally from the first, and I have
the result from 250,000 to 500,000.


Can anyone help me with this?
Thank you very much.


Tuan Nguyen
