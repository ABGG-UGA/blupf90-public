Dear Dr. Ignacy /Dr. Legarra


I have successfully run single step genomic selection for linear traits (and treating binary trait as linear) using the sequence:
renumf90 > pregsf90 > airemlf90 > postgsf90 > predictf90 /and or predf90 . 

these steps, i have automated in using windows batch file (preparing different .par file for each run from renumf90 to predictf90) 



However, I would like to run: thrgibbs1f90 for binary trait and gibbs1f90 for other linear traits. In the manual I dont see very clear steps along with example ".par" files to run these steps. In the Programs chart in the manual, I presume that this is the sequence:


renumf90 > pregsf90 > thrgibbs1f90 or gibbs1f90 > postgibbsf90 > postgsf90 > predictf90  (????)


Do you have any resource where I can see examples of ".par" files for thrgibbs1f90  and postgibbsf90 ?




Thank you very much, many thanks in advance
