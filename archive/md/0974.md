HiI'm running GWAS single-step analysis using the BLUPf90 family programs.I ran renumf90 and airemlf90 without
error.When I run POSTGSF90, it runs all the steps, but it does not save the results.Attached is the final information
that appears on the screen and the analysis log.Can someone help me?Thanks!
