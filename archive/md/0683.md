Huimin,
1. The layout of covariance components in G is common in AIREMLF90 and GIBBS3F90. See a dokuwiki page: faq.parameter [BLUPF90]

   faq.parameter [BLUPF90] Wrong data file name. Check outputs for the data file name and the number of records on the screen. The program does not stop if the wrong file name exists. Wrong pedigree file name.

2. GIBBS3F90 (and other Gibbs sampling programs) put 0 to all the solutions (i.e. 'fixed' and 'random' effects) before the round 1 even though you set the starting values to variance components. In round 1, the solutions will be sampled based on zeros in solutions with user-supplied variance components. The sampled solutions are at the burn-in phase so samples for dispersion parameters will be extreme values.
