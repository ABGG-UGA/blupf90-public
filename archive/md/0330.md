Hi All,
I have reml estimates for variance components and I want to use them as priors for gibbs sampling. how do I choose the
values for degree of belief?I have read the documentation of thrgibbs1f90, but it didn't clarify this issue. is there
any source that explain degree of belief in a simple way?
