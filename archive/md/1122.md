Dear blupf90 group, 
I need help in two issues regarding GIBBS1F90 and THRGIBBS1F90:
1) What does it mean the "degrees of belief" in priors for variance components? What values are suggested for use?
2) I want to run THRGIBBS1F90 inside a bash script. For GIBBS1F90 I used:
echo renf90.par | gibbs3f90 --rounds 1800000 --burnin 180000 --thin 100 | tee saida_gibbs.log

However, for the THRGIBBS1F90, this didn't work (the software didn't recognize the parameter file). Any suggestions?


Since now, I thank for the attention and help.


Best regards,
Juliana.
