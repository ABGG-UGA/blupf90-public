There are a few options.
 The first one is to add random regression for residuals. Like in Nobre et al study. 
 Second is to use gibbs3f90 with clusters of residuals.
 Third is to use AIREMLF90 that can have functions of residuals.
 The last one is add own programming to blupf90.

Subject: [blupf90] MT weights


 Hi allAny idea on how to fit a MT model providing different weights for each one of the traits. Right now blupf90 programs only allow for a single weight but we need one trait to be weighted by one variable and the other by other variable. The solution we have taken, so far, is to use as single weight the product of the two different original weights. What do you think about this?RegardsJuan Pablo
