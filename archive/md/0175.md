Dear all,
 I would like to know if the number of genotyped animals are not many (let's say 700 animals), but the number of phenotypes are many (~ 32000), is it a suitable number for doing GWAS using blupf90. Since blupf90 can use the information of non-genotyped animals for association. However, I am not sure if the number of genotyped animals are enough in this case for capturing the variation in situation when all phenotypes are used?

 Regards,
 Marzieh
