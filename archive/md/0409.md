Le 13/11/2014 11:11, agngenetics@... [blupf90] a Ã©critÂ :

Â In a model with animal and permanent environment modelled wit a random regression (3rd order polynomial), I get the following error messages:
Â G not positive definite: fixed (setup_g)Â G not positive definite: fixed (setup_g)

followed by
Â *** Warning *** corrected Covariance MatrixÂ  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  5Â  times



Since I have 2 covariance matrices for the 2 different random regressions, I assume that having 2 warning messages means that both of them are non positive definite. I would like to know whether this could my a mis-parametrisation from my side and if so, how to improve....




 If it is a misparameterization it would pop up at the very beginning. The **warning** is during the iteration process and means that the matrix formed in the AI iteration is not semipositive definite.

 This means that the estimates are poor (e.g. by few data) and/or the AI algorithm is going out of bounds at the beginning. 
 First, check your initial matrices, i.e. using eigenvalue decomposition in R, and make sure that they are positive definite and small eigenvalues are not too small.

 Second, the safest strategy is to try a few EM iterations first, then switch to AI . This can be done using:
OPTION EM-REML n
where n is the number of initial iterations of EM-REML
