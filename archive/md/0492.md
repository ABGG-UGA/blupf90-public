Mike,Â the renumbered pedigree file has the original ID at column number 10.Â 
You will have to merge IDs and ebvs from "solutions" file with columsn number 1 and 10 from "renadd**.ped" in order to
have original ID and ebvs. Â

Â After using RENUMF90 animal IDs are renumbered and BVs from REMLF90 are estimated for renumbered IDs.Â  How can I get
an REMLF90 output where BV and original IDs are side by side?Mike
