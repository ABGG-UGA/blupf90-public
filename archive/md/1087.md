Hi Delight,
It says, the data file "renf90.dat" doesn't have enough columns so the program failed to read the data. It may happen
when you manually edit the parameter or data files after you ran renumf90. MY guess is: 1) edited the data file so that
the number of columns is not the same over all rows, or 2) edited the parameter file to read an extra column which is
not in the data file.
