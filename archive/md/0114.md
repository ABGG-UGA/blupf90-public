 The question is a bit confusing. If I understand correctly, you want to estimate genetic parameters using SNPs.
 You can use AIREMLF90 using genomic tools by adding a "snp file" (as for doing single step) and a "fake" pedigree of
"unrelated" animals:
 1 0 0
 2 0 0
 ...
 n 0 0

 this will be equivalent to a GBLUP (GREML in fact).

 Note that for G to be invertible, Airemlf90 will blend it, so that the best is to follow the suggestions in page 17 of
these slides:

 Hi,

 I was wondering if variance component estimation is available for BLUP_SNP if no pedigree file is available.
 I know this can be done using BayesX, but can the SNP variance also be estimated by AIREML directly (so without
estimating genetic variance through the pedigree)?

 Thanks,
 Arne
