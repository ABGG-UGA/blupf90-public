Thank Andres very much
In the first case, when I put additive and maternal effects together in the RANDOM_GROUP as

 RANDOM_GROUP
 2 3                     # 2 and 3 are animal and dam id respectively
 RANDOM_TYPE
 add_animal
 FILE
 renadd02.ped
 (CO)VARIANCES
    1.0000      0.10000    
   0.10000       1.0000

HOW can I set up the degrees of belief for two of them

I did try 
OPTION prior 2 4 3 4 -1 4 : but it did not work, the program would stop immediately. the error is that 
***wrong number of parameters
It should be equal to (# random effect + 1) * 2 = 4
OPTION prior rndeff1 db1 rndeff2 db2 â€¦ effn dbn -1 dbres

SO, then I removed one of the degrees of belief

OPTION prior 2 4 -1 4: it worked well. (but I did not have the degree of belief for maternal effect).

I am just trying to learn how to run thrgibbs1f90.exe, so I am not sure that if the set up for prior is necessary. but is it any possible way for me to give the values for degree of belief for both of the effects?

Could anyone please help me with this?
Thanks.
