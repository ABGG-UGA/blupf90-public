Hello, 
I am running a bivariate analysis to obtain genetic parameters using airemlF90. The univariate analysis appears to be
working however, the bivariate analysis stops at this line "finished peds in 5.865163 s,4878670  nonzeroe" and provides
the following error :
"374509.14user 18087.54system 17:06:04elapsed 637%CPU (0avgtext+0avgdata 39062352maxresident)k16inputs+905768outputs
(0major+81090508minor)pagefaults 0swaps"
I am wondering if anyone has come across this error before or can provide some insight. My colleges and I are stumped
at what is happening. 
Thank you very much.
