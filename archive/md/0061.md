Dear Ignacio,
 I hope you are fine,I have some questions please:
 1- I entered the oreder as shown:C:\Users\Soli\Desktop\THRGIBBSF90\32 bit>inbupgf90 --pedfile WP1.txt --fmt "(3a8)"
--yob --ngen (3) --mngen (0) --niter (1) --method (1)
 I is not working, I don't know where is the problem, but I think the problem is in fmt "(3a8)" but I am not sure. It
keeps showing me this:

 Ordering will be performed by: Year of Birth
 forrtl: severe (62): syntax error in format, unit -5, file Internal Formatted Read or DECODE

 2- The year of birth, should I renumber it from 1 for the earliest or leave the last two digits of the year? but when
I did the last one I found that year 2000 to 2009 are only one digit will that work with the software?

 3- I have animals with missing both sire and dam should I keep them or I should remove them?
 Thank you so much for your concern.
