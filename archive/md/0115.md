Dear All
 I am Duy, i am currently working on feed efficiency in pig (for both GWAS and Genomic selection).
 I have read through papers "Genome-wide association mapping including phenotypes from relatives without genotype". I
wonder that there are some examples available for the method now? Any upcoming course (in Europe for BLUPF90 ? 
 Thank 
 Duy Ngoc Do
