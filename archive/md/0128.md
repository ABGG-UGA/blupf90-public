gibbs1f90 requires consecutive numbering. You don't have animals 7-10 so you may renumber. Try one trait and blupf90
first.
 Alternatively you can try the renumbering program renumf90. It will do some quality control for you.

 Hi everyone,
 I was trying to run a two traits aniaml model in Gibbs190, but I don't quite understand how to set up the parameter
file correctly. I was looking at some of the example in the wiki page, but I am not sure on how to do it because
unfortunately there are not pedigree and data file for the 7th example in example page at wiki
(http://nce.ads.uga.edu/wiki/doku.php?id=faq.example ).In fact I have problem with effects part in parameter file.
Could you help me in parameter file for this short example?
 Data file(data):

 11 1 10 20
 12 3 12 22
 13 2 13 25
 14 3 11 23
 15 3 10 20
 16 2 10 23
 17 3 13 21
 18 2 11 22
 19 1 14 24
 20 1 10 25

 Pedigree file(ped):
 animal sire dam
 11 1 4
 12 1 5
 13 1 5
 14 2 6
 15 2 6
 16 2 6
 17 3 4
 18 3 4
