 Hardly thanks for your reply.But as i said, i can't understand what is difference between maternal permanent environmental and common environmental effects. So i can't make a suitable data structure for this effect. I need some suitable information abut common environmental effect and the difference between them. Please let me i have your great idea, and (if is there and it is possible) an example parameter file for that effects.


Thanks a gain
