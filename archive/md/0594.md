## 594: missing values in effects

```
 Is it forbidden to have individuals in the dataset with a missing value in some effect?
 Say, for example, that I have lost the sex code of someone (or the value is obviously mistaken).
 Can I still use the subject in my data or should I remove it?

 From my tests, if the variable is a regressor, a value of 0 is interpreted as a value rather than a code for missing value.
 On the other hand, if the variable is categorical (i.e. cross-classified), then the programs run, but the results are quite erratic.

 Thanks
