Hello!

I'm starting to use the BLUPF90 family and I'm having problems to estimate the heritability. First, I can't find in the parameters card where I specify the linear and quadratic effect of the covariables. Second, when I run the AIREMLF90, I don't have the heritabilities for the traits. 
I am testing the program with a datafile that I already have the variances and heritability to learn who use the program and then apply on my master's datafile.


Thanks for the help!
