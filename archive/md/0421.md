You can do that treating PTA as phenotypes. Also you need heritability for PTA, and if they have greatly different
accuracies, weigh each PTA using WEIGHTS. 
 Note that if PTAs are for both bulls and cows, there will be double-counting.

  Â Hi-


Is it possible to do a GWAS using postgsf90 if you already have a file of deregressed breeding values to use as a
starting point? I already have the PTA, pedigree, and marker files, but the PTA were NOT estimated using other UGA
programs, so I don't have, for example, a solutions file. Do we need to run a round of iteration with pregsf90 and one
of the REML programs to get all of the matrices set-up, and then replace that solutions file with our phenotypes
(deregressed PTA) file?

 Any suggestions are appreciated!



 Best wishes,

 John
