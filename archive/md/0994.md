What program are you using? If you use airemlf90, you can try "OPTION EM-REML n" where n is the number of rounds
running as remlf90 (EM-REML), and then the program automatically switches to AI-REML. In running EM-REML, you can
adjust the number of roundsÂ so that the convergence should reach < 1e-08. It sometimes works to get very good starting
values for airemlf90. Or you may need to reduce the order of random regressions. If nothing works, forget about
airemlf90, and try Gibbs sampling programs.
