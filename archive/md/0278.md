Use:
RANDOM
diagonal


This should make any effect as random


In your case:
EFFECT 
1 1 0 cross numeric
RANDOM
diagonal 


if you want to specify covariances add: 
(CO)VARIANCES 
[here your matrix ]


There more options to use in renumf90, check here:

Hi All,

I'd like to run multi traits analyses. First eu try to run "renumf90" and I always use the contemporary groups (CG) as
fixed effect, i.e.:


EFFECT
1 1 0 cross numeric


But I'd like to run these GCs as random effects.


Its possible?


Thanks,


Fernando Brito
