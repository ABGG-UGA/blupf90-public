```
When you run renumf90,useOPTIONAL
pe mat mpe


See our website at http://nce.ads.uga.edu/wiki/doku.php?id=readme.renumf90 for more details.


In your (input) data for renumf90, you don't need anything but animal ID (not dam ID), but you need dams in your
pedigree file.
You need pe when including repeated records per animal and mpe when including multiple animals (progenies) with records
per dam.
The renumf90 automatically creates those effects in renf90.par, and then you will see which column in renf90.dat is
corresponding to which effect.
