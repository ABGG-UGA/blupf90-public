I want to do genomic selection using preGSf90. I have already used blupf90 for doing GWAS. I have a question now about
doing genomic selection with BLUPf90. For doing genomic selection, I have ~700 training population and ~300 selection
candidates. I wonder for doing ssGBLUP where the training animals should be? Should it be added to the genotype file
where the selection candidates are?
