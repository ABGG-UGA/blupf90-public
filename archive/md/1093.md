Hi,
Please make sure if you are really using remlf90. If it is airemlf90, it would happen because the program has 2
criteria: the "convergence" due to change of variance estimates and the "delta-convergence" based on the change of
likelihood. Although the "convergence" doesn't reach the criterion but the "delta-convergence" meets sqrt(convergence
criterion)=3.16d-5 in this case, the program finishes. This is undocumented. Remlf90 uses only the "convergence" so, it
shouldn't end in the course of iterations.



Assuming you are using remlf90, I need a bit more information to figure this out. Did remlf90 finish the iterations as
if it reached the convergence criterion? Or, did it crash? I believe the former case never happens but the latter may
do.
